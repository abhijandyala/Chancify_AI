# Backend Restart Complete

## Changes Made

### Fixed 85% Cap Issue
- **File**: `backend/ml/models/predictor.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed hard 85% cap on formula probability (line 254)
  - Removed hard 85% cap on final blended probability (line 329)
  - Removed hard 85% cap on fallback confidence interval (line 263)
  - Set new maximum to 98% for realistic probability ranges

### Test Results
Tested 4 scenarios with the updated code:
1. **Strong student → Carnegie Mellon**: 16.5% (was 85%)
2. **Average student → Carnegie Mellon**: 3.9% (was 85%)
3. **Weak student → Carnegie Mellon**: 2.0% (was 85%)
4. **Strong student → Penn State**: 80.8%

**Validation**: ✅ All tests passed - probabilities now vary correctly based on inputs!

## Current Status

### Backend Running
- **URL**: `http://0.0.0.0:8000`
- **Status**: ✅ Running and listening
- **Ngrok**: Active tunnel (existing endpoint)

### What Works Now
✅ Dynamic probability calculations based on:
- Student GPA (weighted/unweighted)
- Test scores (SAT/ACT)
- Extracurricular activities
- College acceptance rate
- College selectivity tier
- Major selection

✅ Probabilities range from 2% to ~98% (realistic values)
✅ Elite university calibration applied for competitive schools
✅ Hybrid ML + Formula prediction working correctly

## Next Steps

1. Test on website: Go to your Railway frontend and try the admission calculator
2. Verify probabilities: They should now reflect realistic admission chances
3. Check different colleges: Try schools with varying acceptance rates

## Technical Details

### Elite Calibration System
For highly selective colleges (like Carnegie Mellon):
- Raw formula predictions are scaled down to realistic values
- Carnegie Mellon (14% acceptance rate) uses calibration factor of 0.2555
- Maximum realistic probability for elite schools is capped at ~28%
- This ensures predictions align with actual admission statistics

### Example Output
```
Strong student (GPA 3.9, SAT 1520) to Carnegie Mellon:
- Formula Probability: 68.7%
- ML Probability: 58.0%
- Elite Calibration Applied: ✅
- Final Probability: 16.5%
- Confidence Interval: 6.0% - 27.0%
```

The system now provides **realistic, data-driven admission probabilities** instead of a fixed 85% for everyone!
