# Database Setup Instructions

## What I Need From You

To complete the database setup, I need your **database password** that you set when creating the Supabase project.

### Step 1: Get Your Database Password

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Click on your "Chancify_Database" project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Database**
4. Look for "Connection string" or "Database password"
5. Copy the password (it's the part after `postgres:` in the connection string)

### Step 2: Give Me the Password

Once you have it, give me:
```
Database Password: [your-password-here]
```

### Step 3: I'll Complete Setup

Once I have the password, I'll:
1. ✅ Create all database tables in Supabase
2. ✅ Set up Row Level Security (RLS)
3. ✅ Test the database connection
4. ✅ Seed with sample college data
5. ✅ Test the API endpoints

## What's Already Built

✅ **Complete API Backend** with:
- User authentication (signup/login)
- Profile management
- Academic data storage
- Extracurricular activities
- College reference data
- **Probability calculations** (using our scoring system!)
- Railway deployment configuration

✅ **Database Schema** with 7 tables:
- `user_profiles` - Student basic info
- `academic_data` - GPA, test scores, courses
- `extracurriculars` - Activities and leadership
- `colleges` - College reference data
- `saved_colleges` - User's college list
- `probability_calculations` - Cached results

✅ **Security** with:
- Row Level Security (RLS)
- JWT authentication
- User data isolation

## Next Steps After Database Setup

1. **Test API**: I'll show you how to test all endpoints
2. **Add Sample Data**: Seed colleges database
3. **Frontend Integration**: Connect to our TypeScript scoring lib
4. **Deploy**: Push to Railway

### Deployment
```
railway.json                   # Railway deployment config
```

## What You Can Do Now

1. **Give me the database password** → I'll complete setup
2. **Or**: I can guide you through running the SQL migration yourself

## Testing the API

Once setup is complete, you'll be able to:

```bash
# Start the API
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/docs  # Swagger UI
```

## Ready When You Are!

Just provide the database password and I'll finish the setup in 5 minutes.
