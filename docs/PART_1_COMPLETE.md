## Key Design Decisions

### 1. **Hybrid Probability Model**
- **Decision**: Combine factor-based scoring (40%) with ML predictions (60%)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Factor-based: Interpretable, explainable to users
  - ML-based: Captures complex patterns in historical data
  - Hybrid: Best of both worlds

### 2. **Comprehensive Factor Set**
- **Decision**: 20 factors totaling 100% weight
- **Rationale**:
  - Covers all aspects of holistic admissions
  - Based on Common Data Set standards
  - Aligned with admission officer priorities
  - Allows for college-specific adjustments

### 3. **JSON Schemas for Validation**
- **Decision**: Formal JSON schemas for all data structures
- **Rationale**:
  - Type safety and validation
  - Documentation as code
  - Easy to generate TypeScript types
  - API contract clarity

### 4. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Decision**: Clear backend/frontend separation with REST API
- **Rationale**:
  - Independent scaling
  - Technology flexibility
  - Clear API boundaries
  - Easier testing

### 5. **Documentation-First Approach**
- **Decision**: Extensive documentation before coding
- **Rationale**:
  - Clear project vision
  - Alignment on methodology
  - Reference for implementation
  - Onboarding for future developers
