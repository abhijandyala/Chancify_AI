# ✅ Scrolling & Disclaimer Fix Complete

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Scrolling Issue**
**Problem:** Users couldn't scroll all the way down on the home page
**Solution:** 
- Added `pb-20` (padding-bottom) to layout container
- Added `pb-8` (padding-bottom) to home page content
- This ensures content doesn't get cut off by fixed elements

### 2. **Disclaimer Added**
**Problem:** No warning about prediction accuracy
**Solution:** Added professional disclaimer in header
