# Scoring System Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the **complete, working implementation** of the Chancify AI scoring system. Unlike the methodology documentation which explains *what* to do, this guide shows the *actual code* that does it.

## What's Implemented

### ✅ Backend (Python)

Located in `backend/core/`:

1. **`weights.py`** - Factor weights and constants
2. **`scoring.py`** - Composite score calculation
3. **`probability.py`** - Logistic probability mapping
4. **`audit.py`** - Audit trail generation
5. **`pipeline.py`** - Complete end-to-end integration

### ✅ Frontend (TypeScript)

Located in `frontend/lib/scoring/`:

1. **`weights.ts`** - Factor weights (mirrors Python)
2. **`score.ts`** - Composite score calculation
3. **`probability.ts`** - Probability calculation
4. **`audit.ts`** - Audit trail
5. **`index.ts`** - Main exports

### ✅ Examples

Located in `examples/`:

1. **`complete_calculation_example.py`** - Full Python example
2. **`typescript_example.ts`** - Full TypeScript example

## Quick Start

### Python Usage

```python
from backend.core import calculate_admission_probability

# Define student scores (0-10 scale)
scores = {
    "grades": 9.0,
    "rigor": 8.5,
    "testing": 8.8,
    "essay": 7.5,
    "ecs_leadership": 8.0,
    # ... other factors
}

# Calculate probability
report = calculate_admission_probability(
    factor_scores=scores,
    acceptance_rate=0.10,  # 10% acceptance rate
    uses_testing=True,
    need_aware=False
)

print(f"Probability: {report.probability * 100:.1f}%")
print(f"Composite Score: {report.composite_score:.0f}/1000")
```

### TypeScript Usage

```typescript
import {
  computeComposite0to1000,
  defaultCal,
  logisticProb,
  buildAudit
} from '@/lib/scoring';

const scores = {
  grades: 9.0,
  rigor: 8.5,
  testing: 8.8,
  essay: 7.5,
  ecs_leadership: 8.0,
  // ... other factors
};

const policy = { usesTesting: true, needAware: false };
const result = computeComposite0to1000(scores, policy);

const { A, C } = defaultCal(0.10); // 10% acceptance
const probability = logisticProb(result.composite, A, C);

console.log(`Probability: ${(probability * 100).toFixed(1)}%`);
```

---

## Key Features

### 1. Policy Gates

Automatically handles college-specific policies:

- **Test-Optional**: Omits `testing` factor, redistributes weight
- **Need-Blind**: Omits `ability_to_pay` factor

```python
policy = CollegePolicy(
    uses_testing=False,  # Test-optional
    need_aware=False     # Need-blind
)
```

### 2. Cluster Dampening

Prevents double-counting of correlated achievements:

- **Clustered factors**: `ecs_leadership`, `awards_publications`, `portfolio_audition`, `essay`
- **Trigger**: If ≥2 cluster factors score ≥8
- **Effect**: Reduce cluster factor weights by 15%

**Example:**
```
Student has:
- ecs_leadership: 9.0 (founded nonprofit)
- awards_publications: 8.5 (published research)
- essay: 8.2 (wrote about same project)

→ Cluster dampening triggered
→ All cluster weights × 0.85
→ Prevents triple-counting the same achievement
```

### 3. Conduct Penalty

Handles disciplinary issues fairly:

```python
if conduct_score < 5:
    penalty = (5 - conduct_score) * 8  # Up to -40 points
    composite = composite - penalty
```

**Scale:**
- Score 5+: No penalty
- Score 2.5: -20 points
- Score 0: -40 points

### 4. Logistic Probability Mapping

Maps composite scores to realistic probabilities:

```
P = 1 / (1 + e^(-A(score - C)))

Where:
- A = steepness (higher for more selective schools)
- C = center point (50% probability score)
```

**Characteristics:**
- More selective schools have steeper curves
- No score guarantees admission (max 98%)
- Even weak scores have minimum 2% chance
- Center point calibrated to acceptance rate

## Scoring Scale (0-10)

| Score | Interpretation |
|-------|----------------|
| 0-2 | Significantly below average |
| 3-4 | Below average |
| 5-6 | Average / Neutral |
| 7-8 | Above average / Strong |
| 9-10 | Exceptional / Top tier |

### Score Examples

**GPA (grades):**
- 10: 4.0 unweighted, top of class
- 9: 3.9-4.0 unweighted
- 8: 3.7-3.9 unweighted
- 7: 3.5-3.7 unweighted
- 5: 3.0-3.3 (average)

**Testing:**
- 10: SAT 1580-1600, ACT 36
- 9: SAT 1520-1580, ACT 35
- 8: SAT 1450-1520, ACT 33-34
- 7: SAT 1380-1450, ACT 31-32
- 5: SAT 1100-1200, ACT 22-24

**Essay:**
- 10: Exceptional storytelling, authentic, memorable
- 9: Excellent writing, clear voice, impactful
- 8: Strong essay, good story, well-written
- 7: Good essay, competent writing
- 5: Average essay, generic topic

}
```

## Testing

### Run Python Example

```bash
cd Chancify_AI
python examples/complete_calculation_example.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- Student profile summary
- Probability for 3 colleges
- Category classification (reach/target/safety)
- Strengths and weaknesses
- Recommendations

### Run TypeScript Example

```bash
cd frontend
npx ts-node ../examples/typescript_example.ts
```

---

## Integration with APIs

### Backend API Route (FastAPI)

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter
from core import calculate_admission_probability

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/api/predict")
async def predict(
    factor_scores: dict,
    college_id: str
):
    # Fetch college data
    college = get_college(college_id)
    
    # Calculate probability
    report = calculate_admission_probability(
        factor_scores=factor_scores,
        acceptance_rate=college.acceptance_rate,
        uses_testing=college.uses_testing,
        need_aware=college.need_aware
    )
    
    return report.to_dict()
```

### Frontend API Call (React)

```typescript
import { calculateProbability } from '@/lib/scoring';

async function getProbability(
  scores: FactorScores,
  collegeId: string
) {
  // Option 1: Calculate client-side (instant)
  const college = await fetchCollege(collegeId);
  const report = calculateProbability(
    scores,
    college.acceptanceRate,
    college.policy
  );
  
  // Option 2: Call backend API
  const response = await fetch('/api/predict', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ factor_scores: scores, college_id: collegeId })
  });
  
  return response.json();
}
```

---

## Performance

### Computational Complexity

- **Score calculation**: O(n) where n = 20 factors
- **Single probability**: ~0.1ms (Python), ~0.05ms (TypeScript)
- **Batch of 20 colleges**: ~2ms (Python), ~1ms (TypeScript)

**Conclusion**: Fast enough for real-time client-side calculation. No need to call backend for every calculation.

---

## Validation

### Built-in Checks

```python
# Weights sum to 100%
assert total_weight() == 100.0

# Scores clamped to 0-10
score = clamp_score(score, 0, 10)

# Probability clamped to 2-98%
prob = max(0.02, min(0.98, prob))
```

### Test Cases Included

See `examples/complete_calculation_example.py` for comprehensive test scenarios.

---

## Calibration

### Default Calibration

Uses heuristic approach based on acceptance rate:

```python
def default_calibration(acceptance_rate):
    # More selective = steeper curve
    A = 0.012 + 0.02 * (0.15 - acceptance_rate)
    
    # Center point where P ≈ acceptance_rate
    C = 600 - (1/A) * log(R / (1-R))
    
    return (A, C)
```

### Future: Per-College Calibration

When historical data is available:

```python
# Train on actual admission outcomes
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(historical_scores, admission_outcomes)

# Extract A and C from model coefficients
```

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Part 2):
1. ✅ Create API endpoint using `pipeline.py`
2. ✅ Wire up frontend forms to TypeScript scoring
3. ✅ Display audit reports in UI

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Per-college calibration** with historical data
2. **Confidence intervals** based on data quality
3. **What-if scenarios** (how much to improve each factor)
4. **Multi-factor optimization** (best improvement strategy)
