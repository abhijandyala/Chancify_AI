## Issues Found & Resolved

### Issue 1: Factor Weights Sum ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Weights summed to 97.0 instead of 100.0
**Solution:** Redistributed 3.0 points across key factors:
- ECs & Leadership: 7.5 → 8.5 (+1.0)
- Major Fit: 3.0 → 3.5 (+0.5)
- Awards/Publications: 2.0 → 2.5 (+0.5)
- Portfolio/Audition: 2.0 → 2.5 (+0.5)
- Interview: 1.0 → 1.5 (+0.5)
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue 2: Missing Pipeline Export ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** `calculate_admission_probability` not exported from `core` module
**Solution:** Added pipeline imports to `core/__init__.py`
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue 3: Unicode Display Issues ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** Windows console couldn't display check marks (✓/✗)
**Solution:** Replaced with `[PASS]`/`[FAIL]` text indicators
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED
