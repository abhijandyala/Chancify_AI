2. **ACT vs Median** (6.9-7.8%) - ACT comparison
3. **Composite vs Acceptance** (6.6%) - Overall profile strength
4. **Grades Score** (3.8%) - GPA performance
5. **ECs Leadership** (3.2%) - Extracurricular depth

### 3. Hybrid Prediction System

**Blending Strategy:**
- **High ML Confidence (>0.7)**: 60% ML + 40% Formula
- **Medium Confidence (0.5-0.7)**: 50% ML + 50% Formula  
- **Low Confidence (<0.5)**: 40% ML + 60% Formula

**Confidence Intervals:**
- Provides probability ranges (e.g., "45-55%")
- Wider intervals when ML is less certain
- Helps users understand prediction reliability

## 📈 Performance Metrics Explained

### Accuracy (74%)
- Percentage of correct accept/reject predictions
- Good baseline metric

### ROC-AUC (0.7812)
- **Most important metric** for probability predictions
- Measures ranking ability (1.0 = perfect, 0.5 = random)
- 0.7812 = Good discriminative power

### Brier Score (0.1706)
- Measures calibration of probabilities
- Lower is better (0 = perfect, 0.25 = random)
- 0.1706 = Well-calibrated predictions

### Precision/Recall
- Precision: When we predict "accept", how often correct?
- Recall: Of actual accepts, how many did we catch?
- Trade-off managed by ensemble

# Define student
student = StudentFeatures(
    factor_scores={...},
    gpa_unweighted=3.98,
    sat_total=1570,
    ...
)

# Define college
college = CollegeFeatures(

    acceptance_rate=0.0325,
    sat_25th=1460,
    sat_75th=1580,
    ...

## 🎓 What We Learned

### ML Insights:
1. **Formula is strong**: Our rule-based system already performs well (ROC-AUC 0.81)
2. **ML adds value**: Captures non-linear patterns and interactions
3. **Hybrid is best**: Combining both approaches leverages their strengths
4. **Feature engineering matters**: Interaction features are highly predictive
5. **Calibration is crucial**: Probabilities must be realistic, not just accurate

### Technical Insights:
1. **Ensemble methods work**: Combining models reduces overfitting
2. **Cross-validation essential**: Prevents overfitting to training data
3. **Feature scaling important**: Especially for logistic regression
4. **Class imbalance matters**: Must use balanced weights or resampling
5. **Confidence intervals help**: Users need uncertainty quantification
