## üìà Improvement Strategies (Ranked by Impact)

### **TIER 1: GAME-CHANGING (Each +5% to +10% ROC-AUC)** üî•

#### 1. **Get Real Applicant Outcomes** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Impact:** +5% to +10% ROC-AUC  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks

**Why This Is #1:**
- Currently using synthetic outcomes (formula + noise)
- ML can only learn what formula knows
- Real outcomes reveal patterns formula misses
- This is THE breakthrough you need

**How to Get Real Data:**

**Option A: Scrape Public Sources**
```python
Sources:
1. Reddit r/collegeresults
   - ~2,000+ posts with real outcomes
   - Format: "I got into Harvard! Stats: GPA 3.9, SAT 1520, etc."
   - Can scrape with PRAW (Reddit API)
   - Expected data: 2,000-5,000 real outcomes

2. Reddit r/ApplyingToCollege "Results Megathreads"
   - Annual compilation threads
   - Format: College | Accepted/Rejected | Stats
   - Manually curated by community

3. CollegeData Admissions Tracker
   - Self-reported outcomes
   - Searchable by college
   - Check ToS before scraping

4. College Confidential "Results" threads
   - Older but valuable data
   - College-specific forums
```

**Option B: Start Collecting from Users**
```python
When user gets admission decision:
1. Ask them to report outcome
2. Store: [profile_data, college, outcome, date]
3. Retrain monthly with new data
4. Continuous improvement loop

First 100 real outcomes ‚Üí +2% ROC-AUC
First 1,000 real outcomes ‚Üí +5-7% ROC-AUC
First 10,000 real outcomes ‚Üí +8-10% ROC-AUC
```

**Option C: Partner with High Schools/Counselors**
```python
Approach:
1. Partner with college counselors
2. Get anonymized admission data
3. Historical data (last 3-5 years)
4. Expected: 1,000-10,000 real outcomes

Benefit: Clean, verified data
Challenge: Privacy concerns, need agreements
```

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Create data collection pipeline
2. Build scraper for Reddit (start here - easiest)
3. Clean and validate data
4. Retrain models monthly
5. A/B test new vs old models
6. Deploy best performer

**Expected Result:** ROC-AUC 0.85-0.87

#### 2. **Essay Quality Scoring (NLP)** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
**Impact:** +2% to +4% ROC-AUC  
**Difficulty:** High  
**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks

**Why It Matters:**
- Essays are 8% of admission weight
- Currently using neutral score (5.0)
- Good essay can tip decisions
- Measurable with NLP

**How to Implement:**

**Option A: Rule-Based Scoring**
```python
Features to extract:
1. Length (300-650 words = optimal)
2. Vocabulary richness (unique words / total)
3. Sentence complexity (avg words per sentence)
4. Personal voice indicators
5. Specific examples vs. generalizations
6. Coherence score
7. Grammar/spelling errors

Score: 0-10 based on rubric
Expected gain: +1-2% ROC-AUC
```

**Option B: Pretrained Language Models**
```python
Use GPT/BERT to score:
1. Originality (how unique vs generic)
2. Specificity (concrete vs abstract)
3. Personal growth narrative
4. Authenticity (sounds genuine)
5. Impact/reflection depth

Models: sentence-transformers, GPT-3.5-turbo
Score: 0-10 automated rating
Expected gain: +2-4% ROC-AUC
```

**Option C: Comparison to Admitted Essays**
```python
If you have essays from admitted students:
1. Embed all essays (BERT/sentence-transformers)
2. Compare new essay to admitted essay clusters
3. Similarity score = essay strength
4. Per-college essay preferences

Expected gain: +3-5% ROC-AUC
```
