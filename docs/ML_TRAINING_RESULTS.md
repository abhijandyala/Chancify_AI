## 💡 Key Learnings

### What Worked:
1. ✅ **More data** - 5x increase gave biggest boost
2. ✅ **Simpler is better** - Logistic Regression outperformed complex models
3. ✅ **Good features** - Our hybrid features are highly predictive
4. ✅ **Calibration** - Sigmoid calibration critical for probabilities
5. ✅ **Regularization** - C=0.3 prevents overfitting

### What Didn't Work:
1. ❌ **Too much data** - 10K didn't help (quality > quantity)
2. ❌ **Complex models** - XGB/RF underperformed LR
3. ❌ **Equal weights** - LR deserves more weight
4. ❌ **Deep trees** - Random Forest overfits with depth >12

---

## 🎯 Production Configuration

### Recommended Settings:
```python
model = 'ensemble'  # Use ensemble for robustness
weights = [3, 1, 1]  # LR-heavy (60-20-20)
blend_strategy = 'confidence-based'  # Adapt to ML confidence
fallback = 'formula'  # Use formula if ML fails
```

### Hybrid Blending:
- **High ML Confidence (>0.7)**: 60% ML + 40% Formula
- **Medium Confidence (0.5-0.7)**: 50% ML + 50% Formula
- **Low Confidence (<0.5)**: 40% ML + 60% Formula
