EC descriptions do matter! use big numbers: \"edited 20 articles/week, raised $1000.\" use strong, colorful verbs. emphasize impact.

Additionally in a prestigious side program which only select 3 of my instrument out of numerous candidates.\n8. **Science Fair,** 1x did amazing in regions and was a state finalist in the State Level, did not qualify for ISEF but had a good chance. Qualified but waaaay later not close to application time sadly.\n9. **Decathlon** Lowkey the most time spent with less reward, just did it for the fun of it due to the numerous interesting subjects in it. Got to nationals as a team and placed.\n10. **History Day** Was a major event that I went to state for 3x, became a finalist and had the ability to lead to nationals.\n11. **Research Fundraising Comp**, National Fundraising comp of global nonprofit org, (yes I know people hate these), won major award and secured giant bag for this corp (mainly from businesses surprisingly), got like 250 vol hours from this and won something out of 40-50 applicants. \n12. **Shadowing,** Shadowed a surgeon and a doctor, learned some valuable things from it and got to do tons of hand on assisting. Not really worth mentioning but I enjoyed it a ton!\n13. **Red Cross Club**, Regional coordinator and president of the club, just made it enjoyable and spread it out through the community with my members.\n14. Also have [JHU](http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/c/colleges-and-universities/johns-hopkins-university/280) GHLC Student Speaker Series I guess (program with 9% acceptance rate around)\n15.

But lowkey I’m giving myself too much credit, they were sorta ass.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* **UC Berkeley (committed)**\n* All other UC’s except UCLA and UCSD\n* Johns Hopkins\n* Vanderbilt\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Georgia Tech (EA, defer→waitlist→accept)\n* UCLA\n* Columbia (waitlist→reject)\n* Cornell (waitlist→reject)\n* Dartmouth (waitlist→reject)\n* MIT (waitlist→ reject) ← this one hurt a lot\n\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* UT Austin (EA, defer→reject) \n* UChicago (EA, defer→ reject)\n* USC (EA, defer→reject)\n* UCSD\n* Harvard\n* Princeton\n* Duke\n* Northwestern\n* Yale\n* Brown\n* Caltech\n* NYU\n* Stanford\n* UPenn\n* Boston University\n\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nTo note, I didn’t submit any LOCI’s b/c I had Berkeley in the bag, so probably why none of my waitlists went through. I also submitted like 90% of these apps late (by few minutes to like 1-2 hours), and IDK if that had any effect on what happened. \n\nAs for final thoughts, I was expecting a lot of rejections but man they hurt. Maybe I could’ve gotten more if I didn’t procrastinate my essays, or maybe if I applied as a CS major, or maybe it would all be the same. I can’t help but think that I could’ve done better in this whole process.\n\nEither way, I will be looking at the transfer application process. My dreams and delusions are too big for my own good ig.

Please read the post if you want more details.\n\nWhich brings me to my second point, which is partly an extension of the first, and users on r/MITAdmissions  expressed disagreement with. \n\nCollege admissions is not a pure meritocracy. Besides the obvious effect of demographics on your chances of getting into a school (which I won’t go into any deeper), there is a **huge** luck component to college admissions. Despite top universities (and students who attend them) wanting people to believe that AO’s are some sort of all-seeing power that can glean if you’re truly worthy to attend or not (thereby increasing the prestige associated with being accepted into and attending these colleges), they obviously cannot. \n\nI am not being humble when I say I was not an incredible applicant. I was a good student, yes, with a couple of passions, and I did my best and shot my shot. Things worked out. But I have friends who (again, I say this with complete honesty) were much smarter and interesting than me. They had varying degrees of success/luck. About half are attending great colleges, some of which are at the HYPSM level. The other half are attending colleges which, while not terrible, are not quite of their caliber (t75).\n\nI am not advocating against holistic admissions, nor am I insinuating anything other than what is plainly stated above. To anyone applying in the future: by all means, try your best to get into the college of your dreams. However, please be aware that it is **not** a pure meritocracy by any means. Not getting into a top college doesn't reflect your worth or intelligence; similarly, getting in doesn't guarantee it.\n\nRegardless, I am incredibly grateful for my results, and proud to join the Princeton class of 2029. ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1magppf/college_admissions_is_not_a_pure_meritocracy/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1magppf/college_admissions_is_not_a_pure_meritocracy/", "upvotes": 134, "num_comments": 112, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "results"}

I did pretty well in all of their classes.\n\n*government teacher* — went on the model Congress trip with him and had some really good convos. The best convos honestly came after he wrote the LOR tho bc we had similar interests (polisci)\n\n*BC calc teacher* — ig the only impressive thing is that I took BC calc in 10th grade?? The teacher thought I was very impressive tho for doing that\n\n*school counselor* — I crashed her office so often during my freshman and sophomore years just stressing about getting into college 😭 (so she definitely knows me well)\n\n*Non-core classes recs*\n\n*Multicultural club advisor* — I did a lot of events in the club. We bonded especially bc I was one of the few international students (the only in my grade) in a PWI, so she really appreciated my perspectives.\n\n*Cornell visiting professor* — I took a political philosophy class at Cornell over the summer. There were only a few ppl in the class, so I got to participate a lot. The teacher complimented me and offered to write a LOR for me at the end of the course. According to my school counselor, it was \"glowing.\"\n\n**Interviews**\n\n*Duke* — probably my worst performance because it was my first interview. The interviewer asked a list of questions, so it wasn't like a free-flowing conversation and felt very formal. The rest of the interviews were all natural conversations. Also kind of got cut off at the end bc it was a zoom interview.\n\nThe next 3 interviews happened on consecutive days (oof) and were all in person.\n\n*Yale* — pretty natural. Great conversation.\n\n*Dartmouth* — definitely my best performance. Went on a rant about a political philosophy topic at the end (the interviewer majored in philosophy). This interviewer was also the only one who emailed me back after I sent my post-interview follow-up emails.\n\n*Princeton* — a little bit more formal. Didn’t have that much time. For my intro I brought a bag of hot chips and the interviewer took a picture of them bc he’s never seen this kind before lol\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommonapp essay: not my best piece of writing, kind of stream-of-consciousness because I tried to get everything in there, the topic was about how I discovered by passion for polisci.\n\n**Decisions ED/EA round**\n\nDuke (ED): deferred --> rejected (highkey huge mistake to ED Duke and even I knew it at the time)\n\nUNC Chapel Hill (EA): rejected (appealed 3 times to be considered in-state but alas I was out-of-state)\n\nTulane (EA): deferred --> waitlisted —> withdrew\n\nUMiami (EA): deferred --> withdrew (my essay sucked for this one)\n\nUMichigan (EA): deferred --> waitlisted —> rejected (my essay also sucked for this one) (some ppl told me those two schools were supposed to be my safeties which is why I BSed my essays… Don’t do that.)\n\nUniversity of Southern California (EA): accepted!!! (my first acceptance, genuinely could not believe I got in EA especially given the very low EA acceptance rates in the past)\n\n*sidenote: I got nominated for the USC merit scholarships that give me half tuition or full tuition, but I didn't get either of them bc I kind of messed up during the scholarship interview lol. I did get a merit scholarship that gives me $6K a year.*\n\n**RD round**\n\nUC Berkeley: rejected\n\nUCLA: waitlisted (what.)\n\nUC Irvine: accepted! (also got invited to the honors college)\n\nUCSD: accepted!\n\nrejected to all the ivies (yes my parents made me apply to all of them) but Dartmouth (waitlisted —> rejected) and Cornell (waitlisted —> rejected).\n\nVanderbilt: rejected\n\nEmory: waitlisted --> accepted into Oxford College and Emory College!\n\nRice: waitlisted --> withdrew\n\nWashU: waitlisted —> accepted!\n\nWake Forest: accepted!\n\n*side note about WFU: I went to the accepted students day and it's actually such a hidden gem school bc they've got great study abroad programs and the campus vibes were really nice. The only part I didn't like about that school is the lack of diversity... I went to the multicultural and LGBTQ+ centers that were kind of tucked away in a corner on the third floor of a building, which gave me the impression that that's where all the POC were hiding all day bc I've only seen like 10 of them out and about on the tour. If u don't mind that (and a bit conservative vibes from the student body), then I highly recommend the school.*\n\nNYU: accepted and enrolling!!!!!! so shocked. If you told me even just a few months ago that I would get into a school with a <5% acceptance rate (CAS) I would've laughed. The supplemental was definitely my most polished essay too (spent over an hour revising it with my English teacher bc we couldn't get the wording right). So happy with this result despite what my parents think and I cannot wait to spend the next 4 years in NYC and around the globe!!! GO VIOLETS!!! 💜💜💜\n\n**Additional info**: My parents hired a college consulting firm for me, but I won't talk about too much about it in this post so PM me if you're curious about that. Another piece of advice to future college applicants is to **be wary of what u see on this subreddit (and definitely don't do ecs just bc you feel pressured to like I did)**. Also, just don't stress too much bc I think this sub gives students way too much stress. College is not the end-all-be-all. Apply to schools you want to go to, not schools others want you to go to. And **definitely apply to safeties** (unlike what I did)!!\n\nAnother thing some ppl on this subreddit needs to hear: **Colleges are supposed to fit you, not the other way around.** Don't carve and mold and kill yourself so you can get into an Ivy (a lesson I needed to learn). It's amazing how I wasn't laughing the entire time I was filling out my Harvard application because even then I knew that I would not want to go to a school with a well-known rat infestation just for the prestige. During the app cycle, I kept telling myself that those top schools are meant for ppl who had a burning passion they've been pursuing since the age of 14 and r also super good at it (which didn't apply for me). I understand that even without that, you can get into top schools, so definitely **apply if you want to go there (NOT for the prestige!!!)** **This subreddit gave me way too much stress as a high school sophomore and junior, so take these posts with a grain of salt since US college admissions is really just a random game.**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1m7cm7h/no_research_no_big_awards_no_publications_no/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1m7cm7h/no_research_no_big_awards_no_publications_no/", "upvotes": 63, "num_comments": 41, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|SocSci|International", "query_matched": "results"}

I’ve been trying to catch up, but it feels like I’m rushing something very personal just to meet a deadline.\n\nI’m thinking about taking a **gap year**—*not to relax,* but to have time to grow, build my profile, and give my best shot at these dream schools for the **Fall 2027 intake**.  \nI’d be **18 by then**, still within the traditional age group.  \nI want time to create a stronger application that is **authentic, meaningful, and powerful**, *not rushed.*\n\n**But I’m conflicted.**  \nA counsellor once told me that having a **gap year on my record might work against me**, especially if someone else with similar achievements didn’t take one.  \nThey said universities might prefer a *“continuous” journey*. That made me question everything.\n\nBut deep down, I wonder:  \nIf I used that gap year **wisely,** through internships, research, volunteering, or maybe a personal project or startup  \n**Wouldn’t that show more growth and maturity than rushing into an application I don’t feel ready for?**\n\nSo I want to ask honestly:\n\n🔹 **Will taking a gap year hurt my chances of getting into top U.S. and U.K. universities**?  \n🔹 **If not, how can I plan that year thoughtfully to add value to my application**?  \n🔹 **Should I still apply this year for the 2025 intake and defer if accepted, or wait and apply next year for 2026–27**?\n\nAny honest advice would mean a lot. Thank you so much. Feel free to message me for additional guidance.\n\n**For clarity, as many of you are saying, this seems like a ChatGPT post. I want to say that I did use Grammarly to check grammar, but I didn’t use ChatGPT. The wording and structure are completely my own. I would appreciate it if you could refrain from making such remarks, as composing your thoughts and emotions takes a lot of effort. Being told it sounds AI-generated can feel a bit demotivating.**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1m3a916/will_taking_a_gap_year_hurt_my_chances_at/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1m3a916/will_taking_a_gap_year_hurt_my_chances_at/", "upvotes": 0, "num_comments": 7, "flair": "3.6+|Other|Bus/Fin", "query_matched": "results"}

Science Fair organizer (11-12): I proposed and organized a science fair at my school that feeds into a regional ISEF-affiliated fair.\n3. President of Science Club (11-12): I was super passionate about this club as it was run under my favorite teacher at school. I managed to boost the club membership by a decent amount compared to the previous years by holding actually engaging meetings.\n4.

English Tutor (11-12): Tutored middle school kids in English through a program my parents found. Primarily taught literary analysis skills and new vocabulary.\n6.

After answering her questions, I kind of just yapped about research and my interests (We ran way over the recommended interview time).\n\nRice (7/10): Nothing really of note here, managed to answer his questions pretty well, and that's about it.\n\n**Essays**  \nThis is probably what killed a lot of my apps.

Wrote a lot about everything I’ve done despite coming from a town with little resources \n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App Essay was about my extreme fear of needles from a medical malfunction leading me into a medical related field instead of away from it and how I can understand and be more compassionate when dealing with others no matter the field.\n\nI wrote a few essays on the doubt I receive as a female in STEM living in rural America where sports are more important than education. \n\nI also wrote some on how living in a very small town has changed the way I see opportunities and how I have chosen to help my community in ways that also follow my diverse interests.\n\nI don’t remember my UC essays too much tbh :P \n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n**All of my applications were regular decision**\n\nAcceptances:\\\nUniversity of Montana\\\nMontana Tech\\\nMontana State \\\nSaint Mary’s College of Notre Dame w/ big scholarship :) (committed) \\\nUC Davis \\\nWashington State \n\nWaitlists:\\\nUniversity of Washington (really wanted to go here) —> rejection :( \n\nRejection:\\\nUC Berkeley (don’t know why I applied tbh)\\\nUCLA\\\nStanford (don’t know why I applied tbh)\\\nUniversity of Notre Dame \\\nUT - Austin \n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nIve always wanted to go to a T20 or Ivy League school. I worked super hard throughout high school but I felt like I was held back and then didn’t know how to apply to colleges at the end. I know I didn’t end with very good stats. We had no AP, IB, and barely any college classes. I wish I lived close enough to some big city to take some but nothing ever worked out. I am not the best writer and had almost no help so I don’t think I sold myself very well. I wish I could go to UCD but it’s too expensive. I am going to Saint Mary’s College for Data Science and Computing while also attending Notre Dame for chemical/biomolecular engineering in a dual engineering program. I ended up in a good program after all, but I think I could’ve done better with some help or something. \n\nI should have applied to more schools and I think I could have gotten into some good ones, but the cost of the applications became too much very quickly. It’s tough out here for kids who don’t have many resources.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1lvi924/i_struggled_with_college_admissions_as_an_rural/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1lvi924/i_struggled_with_college_admissions_as_an_rural/", "upvotes": 54, "num_comments": 13, "flair": "3.8+|1400+/31+|STEM", "query_matched": "results"}

I’m honestly just posting this for some perspective, you can get absolutely slaughtered by college apps, but in the end you’ll end up where you belong. If I could offer any advice, it would be that you should know your own value and really not get hung up on this shit (hit me with the cliche allegations idc) but i think it’s true. Like I was so hung up on going to an Ivy League school and making everyone that knew me proud and impressing random people when I could tell them where I went. But like who gives a fuck honestly? (Maybe I’m just salty from the rejections 😂) like truly, I know people who have been very successful and lived very happy lives and they went to a school you’ve never heard of. **Your life doesn’t end when you’re 18** it’ll sting for sure, but be proud of what you’ve accomplished. \n\n\n**TLDR**\n\nAnchor Down ⚓️ 💛🖤", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1lrbdsl/fck_college_apps/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1lrbdsl/fck_college_apps/", "upvotes": 88, "num_comments": 34, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "results"}

I didn’t tell anyone, and dealt with anxiety, loneliness, and this gripping feeling of unease with little to no help. Balancing 7 weighted courses, a night class, and a varsity sport while putting my best foot forward on every application proved to be more than I could handle. I had to cut down from 20 intended applications to 10 to ensure that I was able to write quality essays for each application.\n\nI was disappointed in myself as results and rejections rolled in, and there is still a bit of that feeling that lingers.

But that’s life, and I’m ultimately very happy with where I’m going. \n\nI know that rejection will just keep coming as life goes on, especially as I wish to become a physician.

The dream was always an ivy and my parents were willing to put me through it. Penn and Princeton were the initial dream and I was ecstatic I got in but I visited and it didn’t compare to Harvard and Stanford.\n\nFirst and foremost: If you’re looking at this and comparing yourself to me and getting anxiety, just stop. I want you to know you’re amazing and trying your hardest. College admissions is so context dependent, based on the opportunities presented to us and our backgrounds. I was in your shoes, looking at these crazy a2c applicants and thinking I’d end up at UT Austin (which is an amazing school and I’d pick it over a lot of things had I not gotten into Harvard or Stanford) Little did I know…\n\nReflection:\n\nAll these cracked students are literally 18 years olds at the end of the day. Stop putting them on a pedestal and glazing them. You are just as capable and I wish someone had told me to believe in myself. I needed others like my student council teacher and counselor to tell me I was enough when it should’ve came from within. I kid you not on Ivy day I genuinely thought I wasn’t getting into any of them. This self deprecation is unhealthy and while it’s good to be humble believe in yourself please.\n\nI think college admissions sometimes brings out the worst in people and even online it’s easy for you to believe you aren’t enough. My advice is to distance yourself. Get off of A2C, stop talking to the people at your school who breed this competitive toxic mindset. I think the best type of environment is to read purely informational and insightful guides like some by past students or TineoCollegePrep. He’s literally the goat i love him so much. I also like CollegeEssayGuy.\n\nAdvice\n\n1.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Solve an actual problem and be able to articulate why it is important to you:\n\nEssentially a passion project. So many people create useless npos that solve non problems in their community. Or a lot of them try to tackle global issues when it’s much more interesting to solve a unique local problem. What impacts your community? What do everyday ppl struggle with? Be able to connect this problem to your everyday life, culture, background. In my community entrepreneurs don’t have access to capital and data analytics because they don’t know about it. My NPO wasn’t some global thing (although that can work) but I was able to actually connect with people and help them solve a problem by providing data to them. Passion projects are easy once you start you just have to find the right resources and problems in your area. For me big local impact is so much more impressive than trying to tackle a huge problem with little impact.\n\n2.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠Stop chasing clout and prestige.\n\nMy plan going into college admissions was to shotgun the T20 business programs. I realized that a lot of these weren’t a good fit and my true target and match school was UT Austin. Your goal in college admissions should be to find a place you love and see yourself thriving, not somewhere you only applied to because of prestige. I kinda regret applying to Princeton because I knew nothing about the school only that it was a good STEM ivy. Don’t let prestige blind you, there are amazing state programs that will get you as far as an ivy.\n\n3.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠Pay to play summer programs are not worth it, just further your passion projects or do research or SOMETHING else pls.\n\n4.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠Be unique:\n\nI literally talked about being a Mukbanger in almost every interview and some essays. Every interviewer was super intrigued. If you are a business kid and the only thing you can talk about is placing in DECA, you’re going to be overlooked. I talked about flying cockroaches in my app to UT Austin, farmers markets in others, try to separate yourself.\n\n5.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠You are more than college apps, don’t let it consume your life:\n\nI read this from somewhere that I really liked: “Passion in college apps is overrated, if I did the things I were passionate about I’d be playing video games and partying.” I agree to this to an extent. If I didn’t have a passion for helping entrepreneurs and data science I don’t think I would’ve gotten as far. But you’re literally in high school to yes get into college but also learn about yourself. Have fun. 6.\t⁠⁠⁠⁠You will learn so much about yourself and your values:\n\nI’m not the same person I was junior year.

That’s why the essay ideas and execution are so ass.\n\n2: I see on this subreddit often people hating on QuestBridge/low income kids. I think my results are proof that being a QuestBridge finalist is not at all a guarantee and shoe-in to a top school. Just because you get rejected from a top school and a QB Kid with lower stats gets in doesn’t mean that the QuestBridge student didn’t deserve that spot. At the end of the day being even middle class gives you access to way more opportunities even if you don’t see it that way. \n\n3: The lack of ECs are just due to finances. I joined multiple clubs throughout the years that I had to leave due to financial constraints, or transportation issues. For example Model UN, my school did not offer transportation to most of the schools that hosted the UNs, and thus I could only do one Model UN conference before having to stop unfortunately. \n\n4: The low GPA comes from junior year. Struggled with my mental health immensely and was paranoid about getting kicked out of my house because of issues with my mom. I touched on this in my QuestBridge essay. \n\n5: If anyone has any transfer tips, would love to hear them!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1lf0ptc/bottom_brown_bi_pakistani_questbridge_finalist/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1lf0ptc/bottom_brown_bi_pakistani_questbridge_finalist/", "upvotes": 10, "num_comments": 27, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|Art/Hum", "query_matched": "results"}

I didn’t have a 1500+ SAT or national awards and still got into great schools. Holistic really does mean holistic.

This was a math test for some UK schools, completely bombed it as I didn't learn most of the material (calculus etc) prior to the test, so I had to self-learn. Didn't go well.\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities** (Not in order of significance necessarily)\n\n1. National Physics Competition Bronze. Had to do like 3 experiments, took two years. We had to debate findings, results, methodology etc with other competitors. 1/3 national teams to qualify for international (didn't go cause of covid + war). Lowkey fun but nothing to do with my major\n2. Family Business Cashier. Now this I definitely could've worded it better, but I just said I handled customer transactions. Could've put how much I handled etc. Took up a lot of my time: Before IB, I'd have to work from 3 pm - 7pm right after school, but during IB I just went over the weekends. Full-time summer job though (12hours/day)\n3. MUN Delegate + Ambassador: Went to a few national and international conferences, didn't really win any special awards until after college application season :/.\n4. Boys Volleyball Varsity: Main middle-blocker (position), competed in national tournaments. Won a few 1st place local school tournaments and 3rd as well. Captain in junior year\n5. Piano/School Band: 10+ years of piano, 1st in all the local competitions. Lead pianist for school band, organized first-ever school concert thing\n6. High school student council: president and vice president for half a year, ultimately a teacher took over the president role after half a year. Organized events etc. Didn't phrase it the best though, didn't really show impact\n7. Business Competitions CFO. A few international business competitions representing the school, only made it past first couple rounds. Managed the finances, contributed to 4 business plan pitches\n8. Social justice. For a very specific cause I won't namedrop. But led the event, leading to 300+ participants per year collaborating with all major local schools/universities, and made it to the national news\n9. Some scam harvard leadership program I didn't know about. Saw Harvard and got horny\n10. Founder of an economics club.\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n1. Presidents Honors award from 6-12th grade. (given to top 3 students per year per grade)\n2. Highest honor roll award through high school (40+ IB points or equivalent)\n3. National honor society\n\nNothing else at the time of application really\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nIB AA HL Math Teacher: 7/10? Taught me for 5 years. Knew me very well. I think he had a good impression of me, always hard-working and seeking for extra practice. But it's one of the first Letters of Recommendations he has ever given (my small school almost never asks the math teacher to write one for some reason), so no idea how good he wrote. Spent a lot of time with him though, discussing my IAs and I even did my Extended Essay in Math. So I assume it's pretty good.\n\nIB Business Management Teacher: 7/10? Taught me for only a year, but had the impression that I was the hardest working student in his class. Spent a lot of time with him doing the business competitions, and it was actually him who recommended me to join the team. But it is his first year of teaching experience, so no idea how good he wrote.\n\nNote: You're probably wondering why I didn't ask my economics teacher for a Letter of Recommendation, since I am intending to major in economics. He had a family issue, so he took time off from September to March. I didn't want to make him think about school and stuff with all the things he had going on in his life. Still deeply appreciate as a teacher, since he was my advisor for my economics club, and also was the person who really got me interested in economics.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nUpenn: 3/10 (alumni interview) It was my first interview, so I had no idea how to prepare. But she asked me questions I hadn't thought of before, and it completely threw me off guard. Most of them was just asking about my future plans/ambitions, and I only had a few so it didn't really work well. I know this interview isn't supposed to put a weight on my application, but it still stung as it was my dream school.\n\nUniversity of Rochester: 8/10 (alumni interview). I believe this interview does count a bit towards your application. I think it went stellar. The alumni was a recent graduate not too long ago, so it was easy to find stuff to talk about. She also did IB, so we talked a lot of about our struggles in the IB. We also talked about how I imagine I would get involved in campus life, and since this time I was actually prepared and did research, I talked a lot about how I would get involved in student life.\n\nNo more interviews :/\n\n**Essays**\n\nI am NOT a good writer. Probably one of the main weaknesses in my applications looking back\n\nUS: Personal statement, long story short, was about learning the art of not giving a fuck, and just try random stuff I'd never thought I would've enjoyed. At the time, I thought it was great since it kind of tied my whole application together since I did things completely unrelated to each other, but now I look at it, it is a bit cliché and generic.\n\nUS Supplemental Essays: I think my why major essay was decent, my diversity essay was pretty average even though I had a very unique background, my community involvement/leadership essay was also a bit generic talking about student council, volleyball club, and social justice. Overall, I think these essays simply \"did the job,\" and didn't really stand out when they needed it to be because apart from my grades, my application is pretty average.\n\nUK Personal Statement: I think this was pretty good, talked a lot about my experiences and why I wanted to do economics. A few UCL and LSE friends read it and said it was stellar. Although I think my grades did a lot of the work, rather than my personal statement.\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\nUniversity College London (UCL) (UK) **(Committed if I get my conditional)**\n\nUniversity of Manchester (UK)\n\nUniversity of St. Andrews (UK)\n\nUniversity of Warwick (UK)\n\nUniversity of King's College London (UK)\n\nUC Irvine (RD)\n\nBaylor University (EA) - 30k Scholarship + 20k Financial Aid (RD)\n\nBoston University (RD)\n\nUniversity of Minnesota Twin Cities (UMN) - 15k Scholarship (EA II)\n\nBocconi University\n\nUniversity of Amsterdam\n\n*Waitlists/Defers:*\n\nNortheastern (EA) --> Rejected\n\nCarnegie Mellon University (RD) --> No update\n\nUCLA (RD) --> No update\n\nUCSD (RD) --> Accepted!\n\nWilliams College (RD) --> Waitlisted Closed :(\n\nUNC Chapel Hill (RD) --> No update\n\nNew York University (RD) --> **Accepted + Committed!!

I should've maybe aimed a bit higher with UK universities, but then again, I got a 2/9 on my TMUA, so I assumed I was going to get auto-rejected. I learned a lot from this process.\n\nIf you do have any questions, feel free to comment/dm.

Before I go into the interview, I would like to preface that my interviewer was very nice and even she admitted that the questions she was told to ask by the admissions office were weird. It started off with the generic questions (tell me about your self, etc).

Had a great relationship with them and still talk here and there\n* AP Lit teacher (8/10): Very blunt teacher but said I was her favorite student.

A big plan that I had was to spend at least 3 hours of research into the specific features of each school which helped a lot for the demonstrated interest schools and such.\n\n**Interviews:**\n\n* Cornell: very calm, talked about being involved with Greek life as a POC, perspectives on math courses and research topics (we both were into the same math tiktokers so it was a good icebreaker), and talked about networking with companies and the social scene at Cornell\n* Yale: my interviewer was roughly 70 but we hit it off by talking about Dune and the NBA and NFL. Said that he was happy that I was involved with robotics as a passion, and talked a lot about youth competitons and how hard it's gotten to teach kids fundamentals. Overall was a really good conversation and he said he'll send an angry letter to admissons if I don't get in\n* Rice: Pretty generic, but I came in with a lot of research beforehand which I think helped.

I also applied to some private universites that had an ROI (for consulting/REPEC roles) that outweighted the costs that loans would bring. Wisconsin gives me around 5k in tuiton reimbursements every semester, which makes it so much easier to not have to worry about living expenses and also giving me a financial base to build on. \n\nMy final decison was Yale vs. Wisconsin, and I ended up choosing Wisconsin due to not having enough aid at Yale to justify going when UW Madison felt like a more secure investment due to the reimbursements and great campus and social scene (their real estate recruiting and alumni network was also close enough to Yales to not make me concerned about the name brand of UW Madison. Overall, I still believe I made the right decison so far after year 1 and would recommend everyone to take ROI into account with college, especially with the economic volatility everywhere now.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1l3dzsy/full_ride_soldier_secures_the_bag_co_2028/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1l3dzsy/full_ride_soldier_secures_the_bag_co_2028/", "upvotes": 44, "num_comments": 10, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|Bus/Fin", "query_matched": "results"}

Ended up doing some unofficial leadership/teaching sessions for underclassmen. Also, 2nd chair in the highest level band. My growth just over 3 years was incredible, almost unbelievable to him\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App: (6-7/10): Wrote about my experiences joining band on a whim, the struggles, and how I found my place, thrived, and pushed myself beyond what I imagined, and how I gave back to my band community. Really meaningful to me, and even though I knew that this format was probably overused and probably just \"fine\".\n\nSupplementals: (7-8/10): I felt like my supplementals were where I could really get into how nerdy I am about certain engineering or stem topics, even though my common app was entirely about being a band kid. Just started bringing out the Band+Stem part of me. Ironically, the supplements I spent the least time on gave me better results than the ones I spent days/weeks on.\n\nUC PIQs: (9/10). I didn't have as much of a time crunch to get these done, and after my EAs, I felt much more comfortable with the UC PIQs.

I do wish I devoted more time to STEM extracurriculars because it might have helped me more with the reaches. However, the memories and friends I made in band are just irreplaceable and I truly enjoyed all my time there.\n\nI did do slightly better with EAs than I thought, with GT and UMich defer-wl 😭 since I felt my essays were just okay and not that polished, but I did do worse in terms of UCs than I thought. I felt like my UC essays were just amazing and I'm really proud of them, and was hoping for at least a WL from the top 2 since I got into SD.  Even IK that I got UCSD, the fact that I got elenor roosevelt college, was kind of a deal breaker for me. I'm terrible at history and writing.\n\nI visited UIUC with a few friends in April, and we enjoyed it, minus the weather. I still have some lingering thoughts about whether I should have chosen UCSD or UIUC, because whoever I ask, there seems to be a pretty split 50/50. That said, I do think I'll be happier at UIUC because I'll have quite a few friends going there, and we're all within Grainger.

I did very little interview prep besides reorganizing my resume the night before, so I've listed my interviews in chronological order (they improved with time). I wrote out basic answers to questions that I expected for MD, but I mostly relied on my years of middling 45-second extemporaneous MUN speeches.\n\nAll interviews were group interviews and I think they're all closed (interviewers haven't read your application materials). The interview decisions are also rolling (2 weeks from your interview date) so maybe that helped me (proactive & top students interviewed earlier?) maybe that hurt me (lots of late competition?). I have no idea\n\n* MD (7/10, eh) - I felt nervous for basically all of the interview but I think I hid it well. My icebreaker response had the interviewers asking me more questions which ended up with me talking about community & connections (something I really care about in medicine). I think my statements about basically shadowing my physician parent for all of my life + a specific \"why\" medicine helped me lots, but basically everyone else had this too (minus the physician parents)\n   * Group interview with 3 other students where we all answered the same question in turn (I was last)\n   * Afterwards, we did a tour of the medical school with a NSU MD student! *If you'd like, DM me for the notes I took on the tour! There was info given that you probably can't find online anywhere*\n* Razor's Edge Leadership (8.5/10) - I connected with my regular-style interviewer over Orchestra Presidency and thought I did decently well\n   * 30 minutes of a physical group activity (man was this uncomfortable to do in business attire, we weren't sweating or anything though, there's just a limited range of motion)\n   * 30 minutes of regular interview with a RE Leadership student and 1 other applicant, where we took turns answering the same questions. I think for some questions there was prep time, but we definitely swapped who would go first for each question.\n* Razor's Edge Global (8/10) - I thought I was the bomb dot com with this one! The professor and I were bouncing ideas off each other on most questions. Then I got into ethical trouble with one of my responses (the question was a hypothetical) so uh, prep your responses right. That mistake wouldn't've happened if I moved an outlined bullet point (one of the questions is hypothetical and expects a longer response, so they give prep time)\n   * Group interview with 3 other students with 4 questions asked by 4 separate RE Global Students + a RE Global professor\n* Presidential (9.5/10) - I was one of, if not the, best interviewee in my group (to the point where another interviewee asked for eye contact advice afterwards), but I did answer a question basically the same as another student, so be ready to pivot guys!!\n   * Group interview with 2 other students, with questions asked in a rotating order\n   * They only take 2 students per interview weekend for this (at least for my year)\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal Statement: 9.9/10; was about Neon Genesis Evangelion and talking the different perspectives on life as it relates to mine, especially how the show influenced my own perspectives. My college counselor said it was one of the best they'd ever read, but I think I spent a bit too much time on the show and less on me. I took the prompt from a scholarship thing I applied to earlier and it only took about 3 sessions to finish it: a couple hours pumping it out in the summer (I love NGE so it just flowed for me), a few hours in fall revising it for Common App, and a session to edit. I heavily recommend writing about a topic/hobby/show you could yap about for hours on end! Chances are that it's representative of your life and you as a person.\n\nI wrote most of my supplementals in an October EA frenzy, then was too burnt out for RD and my dream school, so write your essays in the summer guys! I did re-use the \\~100 word beginning of my \"why us\" essay for Fordham, UMiami, but most were original. I track my time for fun, so I'll include stats on when & how long I worked on stuff.\n\n* UCF - (8/10) I spent **\\[4hr (10/22)\\]** for all of it on the day it was due, so it was a little cookie cutter, but I think it was good.\n* Reed - (0/10) I never wrote the supplemental since the deadline was coming up and you could submit without a supplemental, then emailing them it later. They did call me about this twice, but I got my decision before I ever got around to this.\n* Fordham - (6.5/10) **\\[37min (11/1)\\]** I used the same cookie-cutter beginning for UMiami too, but for both I had specific organizations/opportunities in later writing.\n* UMiami - (6/10) **\\[1hr (10/29)\\]** \\+ **\\[1hr (11/1)\\]**\n* UF - (7/10) supplementals **\\[2hr (11/1)\\]** \\+ honors **\\[2.25 (11/1)\\]**\n* Drexel BSMD - (1/10); worked on it for **40 mins (10/31)** before the deadline and only did half of the word count. I was very tired and it was terrible\n* BU - (6/10); my \"why us\" **\\[1.5hr (11/21 + 30mins editing (11/31)\\]** was mostly an \"I love this opportunity + these classes\" essay and I definitely should've included my time at BOSMUN. I did use a [template ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6A6ixp1ab4hAHV8E_LRonyEDppjysYk0r__nWjjTio/edit?usp=sharing)for \"why us\" research **\\[2.5hr (11/20)\\]** that definitely helped and I wish I had it earlier. My trustee essay **\\[2.25hr (12/1)\\]** was mediocre and had potential to be much better, but I kind of when off-prompt and 100% wrote it the day of. I did not believe I would get the scholarship, was stressed about messing up the essay leading to me procrastinating on writing, and was very tired of writing college essays at that point. Also it had a few grammar issues since I didn't really look it over.\n* CWRU - didn't get to writing the BSMD essay before the deadline, so I wrote/planned/researched nothing for this\n* Swarthmore - (5/10); never got around to re-writing my fly-in essays so I submitted them as is (I tried to apply for the fly-in during the summer, but couldn't submit my transcript); also didn't submit Glimpse or an arts supplement\n* USF Honors (9/10) - **\\[2hr (1/15)\\]** I'm super passionate about fandom culture so this was way too easy to yap and write about. A decent amount of time was spent on just culling text\n* NSU BSMD - I first considered it when they mailed me in February with a deadline extension to 2/14 (original deadline: 2/1) and in that time frame there was an essay requirement. I applied on a whim after the second deadline extension to 3/1. By then, the essay box disappeared which spooked the heck out of me from a quality standpoint, but I still applied.\n* UCF Honors (8/10) - anxiously adapted BU Trustee Essay in the car on the way to a MUN trip lol **\\[40min (3/13)\\]** \\+ **\\[1.5hr (3/14)\\]**\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)** in chronological order by section\n\nAll scholarships are merit with ( ). If not (/annual), the amount is total. I got 100% Bright Futures and the EASE grant (1.75k/annual) for Florida schools too.\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Drexel University BSMD\n* University of Florida (EA)\n* Swarthmore College (EA)\n* Boston University (RD) *(I'm coming back for you during MD apps...)*\n* Nova Southeastern University Razor's Edge Global, Leadership, and Presidential Scholars\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Case Western Reserve University -> turned into a Spring 2026 Admit in late April + offered me a seat in CWRU in Madrid for the fall\n* Colby College -> I think I withdrew (I only applied to this college because they emailed me in December and had no supplementals)\n* Florida State University (Rolling) -> applied in anxiety after UF rejection, forgot about it and missed the deadline to respond to waitlist because *I don't really like this school*, whoopsies\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* University of Central Florida (EA) + Honors (Regular, got a letter telling me I was accepted if I had applied and that I should apply if not already), Provost Scholarship (30k)\n* Reed College (EA) + (17k/annual)\n   * Best acceptance package by far. It showed up without warning one day and came with a book, notebook, acceptance letter (with a personal hand-written note about the community of anime nerds at Reed), and confetti.\n   * I only applied for Senior Scholars ('twas thinking \"free trip to Portland!\") and because my friend applied. I was 100% not going to attend (they said they had no merit aid + too far). That Senior Scholars amount ended up only being $300 though, so no free trip to Portland...\n   * Our college counselor got interviewed by them about us in the process of our decisions, and they loved both of our applications.\n* University of South Florida (Priority Decision) + Honors (Standard Decision), Presidential Scholarship (16k)\n* State University of New York (SUNY) University at Buffalo (EA) + Provost Scholarship (12k/annual)\n* Northeastern University [N.U.in](http://N.U.in) (EA) + RaiseMe Micro-scholarships(12k/annual)\n   * Did not submit a financial aid document on time for need-based aid (which I did not expect to receive), but I initially got 0 aid at all. RaiseMe didn't show up on my aid offer, but NEU confirmed that was normal and the RaiseMe aid would apply when I took classes.\n   * I appealed and got the National Recognition scholarship (10k first year, 5k for each full academic semester, and 2.5k for half academic semesters; covers up to 8 full academic semesters)\n* Drexel University (EA) + A. J. Drexel Scholarship (21k/annual)\n* Fordham University (EA) + Loyola Scholarship (12.5k/annual) + Tuition Award (23.5k I think annual & merit but I can't tell)\n* University of Miami (EA) + President's Scholarship (22k/annual) + Bright Futures (6.36k/annual)\n   * Bright Futures is PALSY against private school tuitions...\n* Kenyon College (RD) + Honors (30k/annual)\n   * Digital Letter had a specific mention of my program! Nice touch\n* Nova Southeastern University (RD) + BSMD + Honors with scholarship ($500) + Dean's Scholarship (22k/annual) + Shark Success (1k/annual)\n\n*Committed to:* >!Nova Southeastern University!!<\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nFun fact: Despite the May 1 Decision date, both Drexel & Fordham messaged me about enrolling past that date.\n\nApplication Red Flags: C in a Dual-Enrolled English Course (all other grades were A)\n\n**Advice**\n\n* Please for the stars above, write your essays in the summer. You will be busy during the year and even if you're applying to just a few schools, there's so many steps in general.\n   * I spent 13hrs in September stressing but not writing, 43 hours in October very stressfully worrying about my future, 24 in November too burnt out for top schools (BU, Vanderbilt, & CWRU BSMD), and 5 in December giving up on college admissions (Duke & Swarthmore). I think I could've had a much better cycle if I had taken the time to write just a month or two in advance, so please do yourself that favor. I get that sleep is good, but this is the next 4 years of your life.\n* If you procrastinate, try the following tactics:\n   1. Surround yourself with non-procrastinators. This may backfire and make you spiral into an \"I'm not good enough <--> inaction\" loop, but it's worth trying\n   2. Involve someone who will give you tough love, like a parent. Tell them about your deadlines. It'll probably be harder to procrastinate when you might disappoint someone you look up to or care about.\n   3. Get a friend willing to review your midnight essays on short notice. Expect to receive midnight essays to review as well, but you need someone to have a look over on your work and especially sleepy and/or rushed work.\n   4. After collecting all of your prompts, spend a day writing 1 sentence ideas for your prompts. The next day, cull to have 2-4 remaining ideas. Elaborate on for 2-3 extra sentences. A few days later, cull again and flesh out the one that remains to a finished essay. Have I actually tried this? No, I got it from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/nwabsj/my_guide_to_prewriting_secondaries_on_4_simple/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Adapt the original post's method though, it may be useful.\n* In general, there's lots of writing tips on r/premed about churning out essays because med school applications require lots of them. You might like [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/premed/comments/1ke3uoe/i_got_full_rides_to_harvard_ucsf_hopkins_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)from step 2 and beyond for your personal statement.\n* In general, get a good writing friend/parent/counselor who knows you well and is willing to review loads of essays.\n* Don't be afraid to move a school from EA to RD if you're not ready. I could've worked on my UF essays a lot more had not been scared by my counselor that RD was a death sentence.\n* Apply early so that you can add extra schools to your list. I was told by my college counselor to apply to Vanderbilt, but I never got around to it because I was crunch-applying about other schools. I severely regret not applying to a bunch of programs because I didn't have time AND was burnt out about not having time + frantically writing in October. I also probably would've had way better essays and been able to get outside looks at my top schools' essays.\n* Do not limit yourself! Strive for the highest and **believe** that you will achieve it. When I was applying, I thought of myself as silver amongst a sea of bronze, but never gold. The cream of the crop, but not the cream of the cream. Safe to say I didn't think I had the greatest chance at getting into BU Trustee Scholars, Duke, NSU BSMD, Drexel BSMD, UPitt BSMD or Vanderbilt, leading me to deprioritize these schools and when I did write my essays, I didn't put my all in them or I wrote them last minute because \"who cares if all you're going to get in a 'We regret to inform you...'?\"\n   * Do make sure to plan for the worst though. I'm not endorsing an only T20 application, apply to some safeties that you'd be ok with attending.\n* If you do not see yourself attending a school and it has a supplemental(s) you'd probably have to write, don't apply there. Your time and mental energy are valuable resources that you do not want to waste. This seems pretty obvious, but I probably would've saved stress about Reed if I had thought of this, and I was initially thinking about applying to Harvard (wouldn't be able to afford) before getting this advice. If you have the money, feel free to send out as many applications to supplemental-free schools though.\n* If you're mentioning a decent amount of arts in your application, probably submit an arts supplement if offered.\n* Take advantage of your local opportunities! Most of the ECs I have (youth Orchestra, Model UN, All-County, Solo & Ensemble, ACT-SO, etc) came from 10th-11th grade wherein I had no clue about them earlier or **thought I couldn't do them due to skill**.\n* Don't be afraid to jump ship! I dropped HOSA after 10th grade because I wasn't having fun, and it kept conflicting with other ECs I wanted to prioritize.\n* Only do ECs that you like. It gets easy to fall into the idea of \"I need to do exactly what other successful applicants did\" and \"Everyone's doing something else while I'm the only one doing this\" but you're more than your application. I was an incredibly busy person during 11th grade with my coursework and ECs, but I made sure that each one was both A) helpful in my application, likely through leadership and theming B) something I enjoyed. I could've ran the rat race of boosting my class rank like many of my peers, but I decided not to.\n   * About that class rank, because of how the class rank GPA was calculated, you had to do a bunch of dual enrollment courses because each course gave a GPA boost. I only did 1 each semester for sophomore year, and 3 over the summer for junior year, unlike my peers who were taking 2-3 each term (3 was the max). I took 3 on accident during the fall of senior year, which bumped me up heavily, but that wasn't reflected in my application. Class rank compares you to your peers, so make coursework choices like your top-ranked students if you want a higher rank. That would probably help you with getting in.\n* Colleges (and especially top schools) are comparing you to other applicants from your school/region because most want geographical diversity. Be the best at your school.\n* Check out RaiseMe to see if any of your schools are there. If so, fill EVERYTHING out.\n* If you're in Florida, try to become a National Merit Scholar. That will net you the Benacquisto Scholarship which covers full COA at most (if not all) Florida schools.\n* If you're applying to a fly-in, submit your transcript during the school year. I tried to apply over the summer only to learn that the school registrar would only be in office during the school year.\n\n**Final Notes**\n\nWhew, this was a yap session. My HS years were full of me not knowing about opportunities and doubting my abilities, which I think translated into my applications. The application season gave me more stress than I thought I could have, and it was full of twists and turns. I'm so glad I'm at the end of it now, and I'm still mostly proud of my results. In the end, I think I've gained years of life experience from this, and seeing that I'm going to tackle MD admissions to apply out of my school, I've got my eyes dead set on the target.\n\nIf you have any questions or want any advice, feel free to reply to this post or DM me; I'm happy to help (and I'll be on reddit too much for the next 4 years r/premed\\-rotting anyways).\n\nGood luck with your applications!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1l0x4pm/black_enby_applies_in_february_program_ends_up/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1l0x4pm/black_enby_applies_in_february_program_ends_up/", "upvotes": 25, "num_comments": 12, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "results"}

UCLA has been a dream school of mine since 9th grade and I’m super grateful that I get to live out my SoCal dreams at the #1 public college in the U.S!! I truly underestimated how brutal and difficult the college admissions process can be. This should serve as a reminder that for Asian male middle class suburban-urban STEM major applicants that the expectations these top colleges place on you are very high. You truly have to be exceptional in some manner to get into a HYPSM (as expected). In hindsight, I probably shouldn’t have applied to so many reach schools when my stats and ECs weren’t that spectacular to begin with. I regret not applying to Vandy, Emory, Georgetown, GaTech, Rice, CMU, UIUC, and UVA. Instead I applied to schools I probably had no shot at to begin with 💀 don’t make that mistake and have a balanced list. Also START YOUR ESSAYS EARLY! My supplemental essays were so rushed and poorly thought out. Think early, get feedback, and brainstorm deep. \n\nAlso I realized early on how big an advantage starting early gives people. Kids whose parents push them into a million ECs early on do it for a reason. I didn’t know what APs were until 9th grade, and I’ve been trying to catch up with other people at my school ever since. Many other people had parents or older siblings or friends guide them into doing the right ECs while I had to do everything myself because I had no friends prior to starting at a new high school + my parents didn’t really help much with the process. \n\nLastly, it’s so important to have a theme/ spike in your application. Find something you’re passionate about and connect it to your career interests through your ECs. \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1ks19dl/midwest_asian_escapes_the_corn_and_rice_fields/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1ks19dl/midwest_asian_escapes_the_corn_and_rice_fields/", "upvotes": 49, "num_comments": 24, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "results"}

AP Scholar with Distinction\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*\n\nAP Lang teacher (9/10): Had her as an advisor in freshman year, then had her for Junior year AP Lang. Everyone says she loves me (including teachers) and she writes the best rec letters in the school so I'm guessing it was great.\n\nDE US History Teacher (7/10): Vibed with him all year in Junior year, plus he's a chill guy and I did really well in his class so I had him write a few reccs for schools that needed multiple core curriculum letters. He's a bit cryptic though so I have no clue how good the letter was.\n\nTheater Teacher/Director (10/10): Closest teacher I've had and worked extensively with her to rebuild our theater department over 4 years. Got to read the letter and it basically detailed how I worked my ass off and helped to rebuild the department and became her right hand man. \n\n**Interviews**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*\n\nTo preface, all of these interviews are for stage management. If you want to know how the process works, read the very bottom.\n\nWebster University: Pretty solid, met the professor and we had a really solid interview and convo about the program there.\n\nWVU: They basically really wanted me there so it was not really an interview and more of a Q&A for me to go to their school.\n\nPurchase College, SUNY: Strangest interview ever, the professor didn't even let me talk about myself and practically lectured me for 30 min. Def left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nCMU: Felt like a corporate interview. Didn't get to meet any of my possible professors, hit me with some questions that I was not prepared for (because I didn't expect them to focus on their BXA program), overall probably my worst interview. I tried yapping my way out of it tho lol.\n\n UNC School of the Arts (UNCSA): Got to meet both professors and really got to just chat with them about my experiences and also the program itself. Got offered at the end of the interview because I had to reschedule the thing like 3 times lol.\n\n**Essays**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\n\nCommon App: Talked about my process in building a connection between the academic side of me (through CS) and my passion of theater. Good essay on a seemingly boring subject and focused on the lessons I learned, especially on the process of design and the power of collaboration.\n\nStage Management Artistic Statement: Talked a lot about how I decided to commit to stage management as someone of Asian background (with the stereotypical tiger parents) and how collaboration and community motivates me to put in the amount of hours I do.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* UVA (EA, CS)\n* Virginia Tech (EA, CS)\n* VCU (Rolling, guaranteed, CS)\n* William and Mary (EA, CS)\n* James Madison University (EA, CS)\n* Webster (Rolling, SM)\n* West Virginia University (Rolling, SM)\n* SUNY Purchase (Rolling, SM)\n* UNCSA (RD, SM, Committed)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* CMU (one of my top picks :(, SM)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Georgia Tech (EA, CS)\n* UIUC (EA, CS)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nHow applying to stage management works: For those who don't know, stage managers are the people who are in charge of live theater or events. So when you see a light change or a sound cue, the SM is the one who actually calls for that change to happen. They also do a lot of the communication and management of a pre-production process. To apply to an SM program, you typically have to submit a portfolio of your work. If you pass what's called a pre-screen (the first pass of applicants), you'll be invited to an interview. If they like you and select you (each program usually only has 5-10 people per year), you'll then be academically screened. Then they'll notify you of your decision. \n\n**Reflection:**\n\nOverall, I'm really happy with my results. Only thing I'm sad about is CMU, but since I didn't submit my SAT and the interview wasn't great I can see why that happened. I was def overqualified academically for all of these arts schools (with the exception of CMU) so I may have done a little too much lmfao. I decided to commit to UNCSA because it was my other top pick, and overall I wanted to make a living off of something I'm passionate about rather than chase money.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1krpeee/2nd_gen_asian_chooses_to_go_broke_from_art_school/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1krpeee/2nd_gen_asian_chooses_to_go_broke_from_art_school/", "upvotes": 24, "num_comments": 11, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|Art/Hum", "query_matched": "results"}

He was sympathetic towards my reason for transferring (lack of data analytics courses at my college), which I think helped a lot.\n\nIntro to econ professor: 9/10, this dude is my goat. Super interesting guy with the craziest lore ever. He was also a guest speaker at a student-run conference I went to, and noted that I was the only one of his students who showed up lol. Unfortunately, he ended up leaving my school after my first semester, but he still offered to write my letter 🙏  He is also an alum of one of the colleges I applied to, which probably helped as well\n\n**Essays**\n\nI didn't let anyone look at my transfer essays. My personal statement was very straightforward. As someone with a polisci and arts focused profile in high school who transitioned to a math and business oriented profile in college, I had a lot to explain. I tried to create an overarching narrative to explain my change in areas of study, along with weaving in some stuff about my personality. Also, I did my best to avoid all the goofy aah metaphors and flowery language you see in essays posted to the internet because I felt that the clarity of my narrative was more important than how \"quirky\" it sounded. I have no idea what approach the AOs prefer, but I was pretty happy with what I wrote.\n\nMy supplements were a little bit rushed. I struggled a lot with balancing college coursework, my social life, and my ecs with my transfer applications. I seriously doubted my candidacy as a transfer applicant because of my low GPA, so I almost considered giving up on the process entirely. As a result, I procrastinated on my supplements like crazy. But I knew I'd regret it for my whole life if I didn't submit any applications, so I pushed through my self-doubt. I worked on my essays alone in my dorm during ungodly hours of the night. I remember finishing my microeconomics problem set at 4am, only to stay awake until 7am working on my UPenn supplements 💀 To any future transfers, pls don't let forums like this or r/TransferToTop25 pressure you to give up! Also don't be like me and start your essays earlier 😭 😭\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD) - in hindsight why tf did I only apply to three schools** 💀\n\n* Cornell (NO transfer option) CAS -> rejected\n* Columbia -> rejected\n* UPenn CAS -> ACCEPTED!!!!\n\n**Reflection/Additional thoughts:**\n\nGrowing up, I never thought I was Ivy material. I'm from one of those insane competitive towns with a lot of Asian immigrants, and I always had worse stats and extracurriculars than my friends, even in elementary school. My parents gave me more freedom compared to other Asian immigrants in my town lol. While my friends performed at Carnegie Hall or competed at regional science fairs, I did normal kid stuff. This meant that I had lots of time to explore what I was truly passionate about. I taught myself to write stories, make digital art, and fell in love with political history. Even though I knew I was ambitious and had huge dreams, I didn't believe I was smart enough to ever get into an Ivy. During my senior year, I applied to my current school through ED2 and withdrew all of my Ivy applications. I love my current school a lot, but part of me regretted the decision. What if I actually could get in? So during my freshman year of college, I threw my hat in the ring, and it worked.\n\nAlthough I ended up changing my career aspirations, the interests I cultivated on my own were a huge help to my application and have helped me gain access to a lot of cool opportunities while in college. I used to think my parents raised me wrong because I wasn't as talented as the people I grew up with. I now realize I was wrong. Because in the end, the ambition and determination I gained from my upbringing, not just my raw intelligence, helped me get accepted.

Good, well rounded unique essay which I am pretty proud of. \n\n*Supplements:* I had a few essays lined up that I can snip pieces out of to fulfill supplements.\n\n* *Diversity (8/10)*: Dual identity, finding a place of belonging, etc. Decent essay, but hard to get my point across if colleges required it to be truncated below 300 words. \n* *Why Major (7.5/10)*: Leaned hard into envir. sci + fine arts -> architecture interest, looking for a multidisciplinary education. Could smoothly transition into \"why school\" segment at the end. \n* *Goals (7/10):* envir. sci focus, international experience, outlines plans for future masters degree overseas. Shows good planning and initiative. Could also transition into \"why school\" segment. \n* *Role Model (8/10):* Kengo Kuma, Japanese architect who specializes in sustainable design. Highlights envir. sci + architecture focus, international differences, current global events/issues. Could be truncated and added onto the second half of \"why major\" and \"goals\" essay to reinforce their themes. \n* *Leadership (5/10):* Orchestra first chair experience, shows strength and a mindset improvement. Overall my weakest essay, not really connected to any other parts of my application. \n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Drexel (EA)\n* UMass Amherst - Honors College (EA) \n   * BA Architecture\n* Parsons/The New School (EA)\n* Pratt (EA)\n* RPI (EA) \n* Tufts - Combined Degree (RD) \n   * BA Architecture Studies /BFA Studio Art\n* CCA (Rolling)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* RISD (RD)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Cornell (Deferred ED)\n   * BS Design + Envir. Analysis\n   * Unironically threw my chances lmao (did not leave enough time for the design challenge + forgot to submit a LOCI) \n* Northeastern (EA) \n* CMU (RD)\n* NYU (RD)\n   * BA Urban Design & Architecture Studies\n\n*DNE Applications:* \n\n* Cooper Union (RD)\n   * Home Test was such a headache and I didn't have enough time \n* Syracuse (RD)\n   * genuinely forgot to put the portfolio in\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* Most colleges gave me decent scholarship due to financial situation + merit aid. The highest aid packages were given by Drexel, RPI, and Tufts. \n* I applied a good mix of art schools and T20/30 research schools so I would have good options when it came down to committing. I prioritized applying to schools that offered the B.Arch pre-professional program, since it is very useful for my future career path. \n* My application leaned towards \"fine arts applicant\" with standout good grades, so I was unsurprised when I mostly got into art schools. \n* I was forced to ED to Cornell by my parents, but I am mostly ambivalent towards the school itself. In terms of regrets, I think I should have prioritized the Cornell app a little more, since I think I do have a chance at getting in. Cornell also loves our HS so that would have helped too. However, I'm not super upset at missing Ithaca weather. \n* The decision came down to choosing between \n   * UMass (Honors college research, decent aid, 4+2 M.Arch masters program)\n   * Pratt (good aid, high ranking architecture school, brooklyn/NYC access)\n   * Tufts (high ranking school overall, Combined Degree versatility, Boston access)\n   * RISD if I get off the waitlist (high ranking art/architecture school, Brown proximity, friends) \n\n  \nI ended up committing to Tufts because they suddenly gave us a huge financial aid package (near full ride). The location is good, I could choose to go into either environmental science, architecture, or fine arts careers in the future, the connections, and the students looked happy there. \n\nOverall, decent outcome!

I think it was good but not especially compelling. I'm friends with a UChicago admissions officer who said the essay was good, but not exceptional.\n\nMy supplementals were a very mixed bag. I spent a lot of time on my UC PIQs and Cornell essays, and rushed a lot of the other ones, which I think heavily impacted my results.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\nBefore I get to the decisions, I think its important to address my GPA. In my first year of HS I had significant health issues that hurt my GPA (2.6) and afterwards I got pretty much straight As. My UC GPA, which did not count freshman GPA, was like 3.9 unweighted. I wrote about this on my application.\n\n*EA/ED:* \n\n1. Cornell (ED): Deferred --> Waitlisted\n2. Michigan: Deferred --> Rejected\n3. Maryland: Accepted (Spring Semester)\n4. Binghamton: Accepted w/ $15k/yr Presidential Scholarship\n5. UIUC: Rejected\n6. Georgia Tech: Rejected\n7. Drexel: Accepted w/ $3k/yr scholarship. Drexel gives everyone some merit aid and I was expecting much more.\n8. UT Austin: Rejected (Offered CAP)\n9. Northeastern: Deferred --> Waitlisted\n\nRD:\n\n1. UC Berkeley: Waitlisted\n2. UCLA: Rejected\n3. UCSD: Rejected\n4. WashU: Rejected\n5. UF: Rejected (this one hurt)\n6. Penn: Rejected\n7. Columbia: Rejected\n\nFinal Thoughts:  \nI think my results are fairly normal for my stats and major. I really thought that I could overcome my terrible freshman year, and I really couldn't. I think my waitlists at Berkeley and Cornell, where I wrote my strongest essays, show the power of good writing, but it could also be coincidence. I could've spent more time on better supplementals for a lot of schools but I'm not sure it would've made a difference. Hoping to get off the waitlist at Berkely or Cornell. My current plan is to save my spot at Maryland, taking a gap year, and reapply next year. When I applied I wanted to do engineering and now I think I want to go to law school, which changes what schools, majors, and essays I want to write. I think having basically no STEM ECs and not having a coherent story to tell made my applications uncompelling and I'm going to spend this summer building a narrative for the next round of applications.\n\nDon't get a bad GPA.

Held the highest leadership role attainable for my job for 2 years, in charge of 10+ Marines.\n3. Created personal finance workshops for Marines, totaling more than $10k saved and $10k in debts paid off.\n4. Held a leadership position 2 ranks above (E-6) my pay grade (E-4) for 2 months during a deployment.\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*\n\n1. A few military awards, but they're not very significant.\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n1. Battalion Commander (7/10): Somewhat generic, but it did its job by validating my statements.\n2. Platoon Commander: (9/10): I worked closely under him for a little over a year, during which he saw my progression as a Marine leader/individual, and did a good job explaining why I stood out to others.\n3. English Professor: (100/10): She described me as a \"dream student\",\"One of the most curious and influential students with an exquisite mind.\" She wrote about how I influenced other students to engage in class, and to stay after class for questions. Truly an amazing professor.\n4. Biology Professor: (100/10): Honestly what a perfect recommendation letter should look like, she wrote a letter that is very personal and beautifully describes my academic relationship with her from the beginning of the semester til the end. She used actual events that happened to help paint a picture of who I am as a student in an academic environment. I believe her LOR contributed greatly.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nYale Eli Whitney Students Program (10/10): I genuinely enjoyed my interview with Yale's AO. The interview was very casual, and the questions asked were mostly what I wrote in my essay, just more in-depth. She was very welcoming and made me feel confident about a positive decision.\n\n**Essays**\n\n1: Personal Statement: I wrote about my life journey, from coming to the states as an immigrant, grappling with racism and being isolated in HS, to finding a sense of belonging in the military, to finally igniting my passion to pursue higher education. One of my favorite essays.\n\n2: Princeton's \"Lived Experience\" Essay: An elaboration on my understanding of nationality and identity, being an \"1.5 generation\" immigrant changed the way I viewed the world. My development and maturity have grown throughout the years, from the confusion of being introduced to the concept of race for the first time, to denying who I am to fit in, to eventually openly rejoicing with my culture, and accepting myself. Had a lot of introspection with this one and it was very personal and fun.\n\n3: Why Major: I wrote about the lack of financial literacy in the military and how I realized it was important for me to gain more knowledge in order to promote financial literacy on a bigger scale.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* >!Princeton University (Full Aid)!<\n* >!Cornell Dyson (Full Aid)!<\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* >!NYU Stern!<\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* >!Yale EWS!<\n* >!Texas A&M!< >!(I didn't have the prerequisites, so it was an automatic rejection, but I figure it would be funny to put on here when read out of context)!<\n\n* >!UT Austin McCombs!< (ouch)\n\n**Additional Information:** >!Committed Princeton!!! Go tigers!!< I am extremely happy with the result. For my veterans or active duty brothers and sisters, if you have a desire to pursue higher education, please do so without hesitation. It might seem like a scary route to take at first, but the sky is the limit!!! I honestly thought I was nothing more than state school material but yet here I am! There are tons of great resources you can take advantage of, like Service 2 School, the Warrior Scholar Project, or a fellow veteran who has walked the path. Do not hesitate to reach out for help, I will happily assist you with the best of my ability. My journey to applying to college is over.

I applied both as a music/music technology major and to the College of Arts and Sciences (if the school had one, otherwise something similar), to all schools. Coming from a small-town public high school (where the average SAT is \\~1050–1150 and only 5 AP classes are offered), I think I was able to carve out a unique profile. Here’s every detail (Self doxxing):\n\n# 1. Demographics & Background\n\n* **Gender:** Male\n* **Race/Ethnicity:** White\n* **Residence:** Rural Vermont\n* **Family Income:** Approximately $50,000\n* **School Type:** Rural Public High School (\\~370 students)\n* **Hooks:** Rural?

Letters of Recommendation\n\nI haven’t read any of these (except band teacher), so they are just my estimates. \n\n* **History Teacher (APUSH):** Rated 7.5/10\n   * Arguably one of only two vocal students in a 9-person class, but I didn't read this (I assume it was good, as my college results are good)\n* **English Composition Teacher (Dual Enrollment):** Rated 7.5/10\n   * Knows my personal journey well, from my unique metal forging projects to my extensive volunteer work, and provided a supportive, detailed recommendation.\n* **Band Teacher:** Rated 6/10  \n   * A solid, straightforward recommendation that confirms my musical contributions and leadership.\n* **Guidance Counselor:** Rated 5/10\n   * A newer relationship due to a counselor transition in my senior year, but she knew about my persistence with college affairs because I bugged her a lot...\n* **Dartmouth Peer Recommendation:** Rated 8.5/10\n   * Written by a friend who currently attends Dartmouth, this rec emphasized my personality, quirks, and integrity, also talked about when I visited and played with the marching band .\n* **Past Church Recommendation:** Rated around 6–7/10\n   * Authored by a long-time member of my church who has seen my growth and dedication through years of volunteering and community involvement.\n\n# 7. Interviews\n\n* **Yale:** Rated 8/10  \n   * A very positive experience, probably improved by my personal connection (my brother goes to Yale), where we discussed my interests, background, and ambitions in a relaxed, engaging conversation, he lived near a place where I used to run cross country.\n* **Dartmouth:** Rated 6/10  \n   * Conducted by a hockey coach; the interview was solid but somewhat basic, focusing on common interests between Dartmouth and my small hometown.\n* **UPenn:** Rated 4/10  \n   * The conversation was underwhelming\n* **Middlebury:** Rated 8/10  \n   * A very enthusiastic interview that left me feeling confident.\n* **University of Rochester:** Rated 3/10 (for me) / 7/10 (by the interviewer)\n   * I mostly listened as the interviewer led the conversation, which didn’t allow me to fully showcase my personality, but he loved the school.\n* **Brown:**  \n   * Instead of a traditional interview, I submitted a video (the norm for Brown applications). I filmed it in a culvert after a fresh snowfall, walking along my hometown road while describing where I grew up.\n\n# 8. Essays\n\n* **Common App Main Essay:**\n   * I wrote about building my own forge using clay from local marshlands, a process that involved navigating beaver dams and collecting a 40-pound bucket of pure clay. This essay (hopefully) symbolized my resilience, ingenuity, and ability to transform obstacles into personal triumphs. I consider it my best-written essay, full of detail and metaphors.\n* **COVID Essay:**\n   * Focused on how being homeschooled in 8th grade led to a math setback, and how I overcame this through self-driven online coursework, and had to juggle an online Precalculus class alongside AP Calculus during the first semester of my senior year. It underscored my perseverance and self-advocacy in the face of limited guidance.\n* **Supplemental Essays:**  \n   * Tailored for individual schools, but most of the schools (especially Cornell, Dartmouth, Yale, Northwestern, Brown, UPenn, University of Rochester, Amherst, and Boston University) all had semi-similar prompts, in which I either wrote about marching band, or my interests in an interdisciplinary study of music and technology, or community engagement.\n\n# 9. College Admissions Results\n\n* **Accepted:**  \n   * Brown University\n   * Dartmouth College\n   * Middlebury\n   * University of Michigan - Ann Arbor\n   * Boston University\n   * University of Vermont\n   * Skidmore College\n   * University of Rochester (really thought I was going to end up here, I thank them for inspiring me with college)\n   * Rochester Institute of Technology\n* **Waitlisted:**  \n   * Northeastern (bums honestly)\n   * Amherst\n   * Bowdoin\n   * Colgate\n   * Colby\n   * WPI (huh?)\n   * Yale\n   * Cornell\n* (I wonder if Northeastern, Colby, and Colgate being need-aware had any effect here...)\n* **Rejected:**  \n   * Tufts\n   * Northwestern\n   * UPenn\n\nSorry for clickbait\n\nMoney:\n\nAlmost all schools were between 10 to 15 thousand per year. \n\nMiddlebury was around 25k, \n\nBrown was initially around 25k as well, but Dartmouth was only 3k, and I used that offer to negotiate Brown to around 8500, which will be covered almost completely by various scholarships and grants I have been awarded independently. \n\n# Reflection?\n\nI started high school without thinking much about college. My brother visited Cornell when I was in seventh grade, and I tagged along. I thought it looked cool and decided I wanted to go there someday. But as time passed (you know, COVID and everything), I started to feel like that goal wasn’t really for me. My brother was the Ivy League type, always focused and ahead of the curve. I wasn’t. I just did what I liked. I played music, volunteered, went to school, and didn’t think too hard about what came next.\n\nIt wasn’t until junior year, when I got first chair euphonium at the state concert band festival, that something clicked. I looked at everything I had done, almost by accident. I had close to 1000 hours of community service. I had decent grades in every core class. I was ranked high enough in my class. I started to think that maybe I could actually try.\n\nThen I took the SAT (Spring 2024) and got a 1350. Cornell was cooked. Later I got a 1450, and we were so back. I spent December and January (a little in November) writing and rewriting essays every day (just for reference, I have about 37 pages of drafts for Cornell alone). In the end, I had around 45 pages of final drafts of college essays for the various 20 schools. I don’t know what possessed me to apply to 20 schools.\n\nMy Common App essay was about collecting a bucket of clay from a swamp behind my house to build a forge. It was about taking what I had and making something out of it. That idea is everywhere in my application (at least I think it is..). I live in a place with long winters and early sunsets, so I built something bright. I live in a town with almost no APs or clubs, so I studied what I could (music) and volunteered wherever possible. I did what was in front of me and tried to make it count.\n\nIvy Day was stressful. We had a senior vs staff basketball game going on at 7:00, but after I went to a corner store with my friends and got ice cream. We all circled around my phone as I opened results. UPenn was a no, which I expected. Brown was a yes. We got loud. Yelling and clapping and handshakes with the bros. Yale was a waitlist, fine (see edit). Dartmouth was a yes. More yelling. Cornell was a waitlist too. Two out of five Ivies. I had thought I might get none. On the drive home, I listened to Runaway by Kanye and leaked euphoric tears (rather unexpected, as I'm usually a chill guy, but dude it was a vibe)\n\nChoosing between Dartmouth and Brown was hard. I live near Dartmouth and know people there, and I really like Hanover. But I picked Brown (see edit…). I like Providence, I like the academic flexibility, and I like that they don’t require a foreign language (I really hate foreign language studies). I don’t know exactly what I want to study alongside music, so the open curriculum made sense for me. Also, I love food, and Providence is good with restaurant diversity. Both schools are almost $0 for me after scholarships, which I am extraordinarily thankful for.\n\nLooking back, I didn’t get into every top school (RIP Cornell). I didn’t get perfect test scores. I didn’t have some polished plan when I started high school. But I cared about what I was doing, even if it wasn’t flashy. I think that showed? If you’re reading this and you’re from a small school or a rural place, and it feels like you’re out of the loop, just know it’s not the end. You can do a lot with what’s around you. You can make something good out of almost anything. I think that’s what I tried to do. And I guess it worked?\n\nHave hope, expect nothing, but be pleased with success.\n\nthanks for reading :)\n\n\n\nEdit: guys I got into Yale off the waitlist! I will be attending there in fall, provided that the financials all work out!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1kby7xu/only_rejected_from_one_ivy_1450_sat_38_gpa_rural/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1kby7xu/only_rejected_from_one_ivy_1450_sat_38_gpa_rural/", "upvotes": 558, "num_comments": 120, "flair": "3.8+|1400+/31+|Art/Hum", "query_matched": "results"}

Qualified for state champs all years of participation, team captain for 3 seasons, and set school records for 200m and 400m that have definitely been broken since I started university\n\n2. Robotics Club: Competed in FIRST Tech Challenge, never won shit but mentored middle schoolers in my school's LEGO League team, contributed to much of the code, and 3D printed toys for fundraisers\n\n3. Red Cross Club - held officer role where I could just Photoshop shitty designs and see it plastered all over campus every time the club announced a blood drive\n\n4. Work (paid) - held j\\*b for half of high school, worked average of 35 hrs/wk during junior + senior year\n\n5. Student ambassador for my high school - basically was a tour group guide and got volunteer hours to shill my high school\n\n6. Repairing cars - college counselor said hobbies were fair game on the Common App, so I wrote about how my dad and I would flip cars to sell on Craigslist\n\n7. Family responsibilities - both parents work, so my sisters have to be taken to practices and whatnot. Probably not something you'd put on the Common App but it was significant enough for me to talk about it\n\n**Awards/Honors:** \n\n1. National Hispanic Recognition Award\n\n2. National Merit Commended Scholar \n\n3. Distinguished Honor Roll for my school (top 5% GPA of student body?)\n\n4. AP Scholar with Distinction\n\n**Essays/LORs/Interviews:** \n\nCommon App essay: 8/10. Wrote an anecdote about how me burning the fuck out my carpet and almost starting a house fire was indicative of me being naturally curious. This was surprisingly a hit with almost all the schools I had applied to, and Harvey Mudd had actually wrote back to me in their acceptance letter \"Don't try and burn down the carpets here\" which they definitely do for all their acceptances, but it made my day.\n\nTexas A&M prompts: 7/10, these are honestly not too bad and I don't wanna kill myself reading them\n\nHarvey Mudd prompts: 8.5/10. Some of the more creative prompts I've had to write\n\nGeorgia Tech why us: 6/10. Holy fumble this shit is so cheesy\n\nPurdue why us: 7/10, same amount of cheese yet better written which is funny because I finished this one the day before EA was due\n\nStanford prompts: 6/10, some of this is banger because I was able to talk about my hyperfixations but the one where they have you write about life experiences was probably the biggest example of fumbling the bag that I've seen in my life\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n* *Acceptances:* \n   * Arizona State University (rolling) - 15k scholarship iirc\n   * University of Arizona (rolling) - 20k scholarship, autoadmit to Honors (national Hispanic scholar)\n   * Colorado School of Mines (EA) - 14k scholarship\n   * Texas A&M (Engineering EA) - $650 scholarship 🕊️\n   * Purdue University (EA) - 12k scholarship, I go here now it's calm\n   * Harvey Mudd College (RD) - Did not expect this shit at all. No aid though so I can't afford it lol\n\n* *Waitlists:* \n   * Georgia Institute of Technology (EA) - deferred EA, applied RD, waitlisted. Holy blueball\n* *Rejections:* \n   * Stanford University (RD) - does a fish swim? I'd reject myself too with the slop I wrote and my average profile\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI got no business being accepted to all these schools and going to the school I go to now, but I'm gonna make the most of it. Georgia Tech was my dream school so being waitlisted hurt like a motherfucker, but I don't regret choosing Purdue at all even with how ass the major can be sometimes. For anyone making their decisions tomorrow, everything's gonna be ok.

Was only asked two questions and I spent the rest of the time asking him about his Penn experience. 7/10\n* Princeton: Older alumni, but still well-connected. Felt very much like a natural conversation and refined my interviewing skills after my mid Penn interview, and the interviewer was genuinely interested in my interests and what I knew and I enjoyed hearing from him about his experience and interests. 9/10\n* Berkeley Regents: Not good at all. Felt more like a rapid-fire question round than an actual interview. Interviewer would always interject and challenge my answers and I didn’t have good defenses for them. Odd questions and little follow-up didn’t help. This was definitely why I didn’t get Regents at Berkeley. Tough interview. 4/10\n\n**Essays**\n\n* Personal statement: Talked about my experience spontaneously singing for everyone at a band concert and how it represented my budding confidence and ability to take risks. Connected to multiple parts of my application. Complimented about it by a few colleges. 10/10.\n* Supplements: These were a mixed bag. Honestly, I think that my EA supplements were significantly weaker than what I put forward in the RD round, but they weren’t bad. I did a lot of copy and pasting between schools and would adjust as needed, so they were all pretty similar in style and structure. I tried to sell myself not just as a math grinder, but as an intellectual (which came through as noted by my Penn AO). I mostly focused on my other interests outside of math and told my story growing up in a restaurant, but I spent a lot of time on these trying to develop a narrative about my character. (mostly) 10/10\n* UC PIQs: Mostly stolen and adjusted from supplements, but poured a shit load of time into them and really tried to make them complex and connected. 10/10\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\nAcceptances:\n\n* University of Oregon (EA + $20k/yr Excellence Scholarship)\n* Purdue (EA + $10k/yr Presidential Scholarship)\n* USC (EA)\n* UMich (EA)\n* UMD (EA + $15k/yr President’s Scholarship)\n* UC Berkeley (Early admit for Regents - did not get)\n* UCSB (Chancellor’s Early Invite)\n* UC Davis (RD + $7.5k Fulmor Scholarship)\n* UW (RD + $5.4k Purple and Gold Scholarship)\n* UCSD (RD w/ Regents)\n* UC Irvine (RD + $6k/yr Chancellor’s Scholarship)\n* Harvey Mudd (RD)\n* Williams (RD)\n* UCLA (RD w/ Regents)\n* Brown (RD)\n* UPenn (RD + committed!)\n\nWaitlists:\n\n* UChicago (RD)\n* Amherst (RD)\n* Pomona (RD)\n* Northwestern (RD)\n* Dartmouth (RD)\n* Princeton (RD)\n\n0 Rejections!\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nGetting 0 rejections and a UC sweep was by far the most surprising thing. Wasn’t really expecting much applying as a math major without AMC or AIME. I thought my application was honestly fairly average as compared with some of the sweats on this subreddit and ended up really surprised with my results. \n\nCost was not a significant factor, even though it did vary widely, but by the end, I was mostly between Brown and Penn. I chose Penn because I'm interested in working on Wall Street afterward and it had the stronger, built-up, and established Wall Street pipeline, but it was not an easy choice by any means. \n\nLooking back, I wish I'd applied to more schools (Yale, Stanford, Columbia for starters) and applied early to more places. I’m extremely happy and grateful for my results, but if I get off the Princeton waitlist, I’m going there. ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1kb4l3q/default_asian_guy_beats_system_w_0_rejections_and/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1kb4l3q/default_asian_guy_beats_system_w_0_rejections_and/", "upvotes": 54, "num_comments": 34, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "results"}

Environmental science is pretty easy so I usually ended up helping my classmates which she noticed. I actually really enjoyed her class and had some good talks with her about my future plans and personal life, which is kinda weird because I didn't know she existed before I took the class. She said I reminded her of her son but idk if that's a good thing or not. Super sweet and super nice lady. Ultimately this is the only AP test I didn't get a 5 on which is lowk my fault because I got waaay too cocky after breezing through all the practice tests in the weeks before. Didn't study at all so I deserve it.\n\n  \nCalculus Teacher - 9/10 - Known her since freshman year because of math team and did well in her class. She's very fair and probably the best math teacher I've ever had. She even met my parents at one point so I'm hoping she wrote a nice letter. Talked a bunch about college options and different paths I could take in life with her. She gave me some good advice about taking care of myself mentally and avoiding burnout which I really struggle with. She emphasized the importance of healthy coping mechanisms and how she's seen too many students with bright futures ruin it for themselves through self-destructive tendencies \\*cough\\*cough\\*. I trust her a lot and I'm sure she wrote a solid letter.\n\n# Interviews\n\nDuke (7/10) - Zoom call soon after I submitted my application. Talked a little bit about the academics but ended up chatting more about college life in general and Durham. She gave a lot of great advice that would be really useful if I was going there, especially about which dorms to pick, professors to avoid, and things to do. Was lowk coming off a brazy weekend during the interview so I wasn't my usual charming self. \n\nJohn Carroll (10/10) - Met this guy in-person at a Panera. He bought me food and coffee when I was having a shitty day so instant 10/10. Had a 1.5 hour long conversation about pretty much every part of the school and I filled three pages of notes up. Dude was super welcoming, communicative, easy-to-work-with, and friendly. It's unfortunate that this school was pretty much my last resort because this dude was putting in the EFFORT to get me to go there. Was also getting recruited to wrestle here pretty hard.\n\nUChicago (3/10) - Recruiting call over the phone. Dude was trying really hard to convince me to go but pretty much deflected all of my questions and kept circling back to \"notthealt42, UChicago is an amazing investment into your future\" like a bajillion times. This was soon after he dropped the $95k annual COA and mentioned that they don't give athletic scholarships or really much merit aid at all. He just didn't have any actual information about the school and it felt like he was just talking to me to try to convince me to commit. Ended up not applying.\n\nLoyola Chicago (9/10) - In-person interview for scholarship. Only lasted about 20 mins. I was one of the last people interviewed that day and my lady was losing her voice. Talked a lot about my car, legal troubles in relation to said car, the beauty of mac n cheese, and the detrimental effects of healthcare inequality on communities and individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, especially in relation to the societal poverty cycle and the unfair burden of medical debt upon families and how going to Loyola for premed will help support my goal of working towards solving that issue. I would give it a 10 but I was lowk sick af leading up to the interview and was so zonked off the flu meds that I don't remember the finer details. Must've done well though because I got a phone call a month later where they told me my interviewer thought I was \"the most human\" candidate.\n\n# Essays\n\nPersonal statement I put a fuck ton of time into. I started writing it at the end of junior year and didn't really finish until October, two weeks before my first applications went out. I did this on purpose. I worked on it bit by bit everyday until it was almost perfect so that I wouldn't procrastinate it until the last minute. and I got as many eyes on it as I could. I'm actually really proud of it even though I clocked in at 647 words which is slightly high. I wrote the essay about pizza. The main selling point of my pizza place is that customers are able to completely customize their pizza, from type of crust to the toppings to how it's cut. I wrote the essay about how every pizza I made was a \"floury caricature\" of the individuals on the other side of the glass and that every topping and culinary-decision represented memories, personality traits, cultural backgrounds, childhood experiences, etc. I then described my personal pizza and the various parts of my life story and personality represented through every ingredient. \n\nSupplemental essays I honestly wish I spent more time on. I got REALLY burnt out really fast, and was under a shit ton of pressure from my parents to get a big scholarship so I (and my family) didn't have to deal with expensive college costs. August-January was also really hard for me in my personal life. I had a lot of really stressful things I was dealing with that made it damn hard to focus on the seemingly distant future. Some of this was caused by my own irresponsible decisions but a lot of it was just fucking unlucky. As a result, some of my supplementals were a little lacking. They weren't bad but they were just kind of basic, especially my \"Why Us\" essays where I didn't include nearly enough detail. \n\n# Decisions (Only applied EA/ROLL/RD)\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* UIUC (EA) + smth i forgot\n* UW-Madison (EA)\n* Drake (ROLL) \n* IU-Bloomington (EA)\n* John Carroll (EA) \n* Loyola Chicago (ROLL) \n* Marquette (EA) \n* Miami Oxford (EA) \n* UMiami (EA) + DaVinci\n* USC (EA -> Deferred)\n* Tulane (EA -> Deferred) + TRIA\n* UGA (EA)\n* UIC (EA) \n* Northwestern (RD) + ISP  <- Dream School!!!\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* WashU (RD)\n* CWRU (EA -> Deferred)   \n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Rice (RD)\n* Brown (RD)\n* Northeastern (EA -> Deferred)\n* Duke (RD)\n\n# The Decision\n\nMy wrestling career came to a close when one of my internal organs decided to implode during a match. Goes to show how relying on athletics to get you into and pay for college can be a risk... anything can change with just a little bit of bad luck.\n\nSo, it comes down to three schools: Northwestern, Tulane, and Loyola Chicago. \n\nNorthwestern - $220k est. total, w/ ISP more like $170k. Dream school since I was 10 mostly because of my parents. My mom went there for undergrad/grad. Spent my whole childhood around Northwestern events and people, especially ISP alumn so I **really** wanted to do it.\n\nTulane - $125k est. total, really fell in love with this school especially after admitted student day\n\nLUC - $78k est. total, full-tuition scholarship. Don't like the school personally and academically weakest school of the three. But I only have to pay room and board which parents are willing to help me out with so its basically **free**.\n\nI have two days left to make a decision. After many sleepless nights fueled by stress and depression (hence why I'm up at 3am (now 4am)) and long talks with my family I don't think I can turn Loyola down. **I have a very real possibility of graduating undergrad completely debt free.** This is an insane blessing and I am so incredibly thankful to have been offered this opportunity. I have multiple younger siblings going to college right after me and my parents can't cosign loans for all of us. Yes, I'm sacrificing my dreams, but sometimes that's just how shit goes. At the end of the day undergrad is a stepping stone to medical school. I'm not here for the \"traditional college experience\" where these are the \"best four years of my life\": I'm here to get in, get out, and ball tf out on that transcript and the MCAT.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nIn total I applied to 20 schools and got 14 acceptances, 2 waitlists, and 4 rejections, coming out to a 70% acceptance rate. By my classifications 7 of those were reach schools or hard targets, 4 were targets, and 9 were safeties or light targets. I also applied for every available honors program and got into all of em. I also applied for **every** additional merit-scholarship I could. Between the personal statement, supplementals, scholarships, honors programs, and specialty programs... I wrote well over 60 essays!\n\nI did NOT ED anywhere because I can't make that financial commitment haha\n\nSpeaking of finances:\n\nThe mean 4-year cost of all 14 schools I got into came out at $171,091.46 with a minimum of $77,800 (LUC) and a maximum of $297,552.00 (USC). It is worth noting that UW-Madison gave me $0.00 in total aid totalling to $259,312.00 after four years which is STILL cheaper than USC who gave me $25.5k per year in merit. Adding up all my annual aid packages over four years as they are today, I earned a total of **$1,412,496** in merit scholarships.\n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1kajnyr/midwest_premed_kid_turns_down_dream_school/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1kajnyr/midwest_premed_kid_turns_down_dream_school/", "upvotes": 32, "num_comments": 25, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "results"}

National Rural and Small Town Recognition\n2. AP Scholar with Distinction x2\n3. That one Mathlete of the Year thing\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n*Note: I haven't seen any of these so I'm guessing mostly! I wish I had more opportunities to connect with my teachers more deeply, as they were all genuinely so amazing!!!*\n\nCounselor - 5/10: I didn't talk too much with him but he knew about me? Super nice guy though!!!\n\nAP Physics Teacher - 7 or 8 /10: I have him for another class this year too which helps I guess! He seemed happy to write a letter for me and I know he spent about 3 weeks on it too! I'd have some conversations and such with him but I'm not sure if I ever fully connected with him (though I would have liked to, he's an amazing teacher and person!)\n\nAP US History Teacher - 7 or 8 /10: I used to draw pictures on his whiteboard at the start of every class with his name in some cheesy pun. I think he liked it! I genuinely enjoyed his class and teaching and he seemed happy to write a letter for me! \n\n**Interviews**\n\nDartmouth - 6/10: My first interview, so I was nervous and kind of jumped through my answers or over-yapped. I learned a lot about the school though, and my interviewer was very sweet! I think I connected with her, but yeah could have definitely been more prepared, especially for an in-person interview. Went about an hour.\n\nPrinceton - 5/10: This one was virtual, and went alright I guess! We talked a lot about my 3D modeling but I don't think I fully connected with her. I asked some questions and such but I probably could have done better. Still got to learn a lot about Princeton and it was definitely educational. Went about 45 minutes.\n\nYale - 9/10: My interviewer and I connected very well I think! He was a graduate student so there was a bit of difference in experience but we bonded over music and food. He asked a lot about my personal life and shared some of his favorite stories when I asked! This one was in person, and lasted a bit over an hour. Definitely felt more prepared for this one. My only mistake was I kept calling him Mr. when he was an MD so I fixed it in my future emails (I hope I wasn't being too stupid :( )\n\nPenn - 3/10: Nice guy, but also definitely didn't connect with him. He asked a couple questions, and I asked a couple. Was really short and I definitely didn't feel prepared for it. I think these aren't evaluated though! This one was online and went about half an hour.\n\nDuke - 4/10: She mainly had me ask her questions or tell her about myself, so I didn't have too much guidance. She told me a bit about camping before basketball games and such which seemed like fun! Didn't fully connect to her though, and she said like only one person she's interviewed got in so I got scared a bit. This one was online and about half an hour.\n\nHarvard - 8/10: Besides accidentally walking into the back of the office into a restricted area instead of the front entrance, it went really well! We talked about restaurants, our shared interest in physics, ideal pasta shapes, 3D modeling, and more! She graduated a long time ago so there was a bit of a gap but that's okay! Was in-person and went about an hour.\n\n\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal Statement - 6/10: Originally wrote for Questbridge but wasn't a finalist. Revised it a bit and used it for my main personal statement! It was about how my sister scared me with a rubber chicken all the time, but how when she was hospitalized and I lived on my own for months, I started to miss it. I linked it to my understanding of autonomy and adulthood and that independence does not equal maturity. I didn't talk about a big difference I made though, and it was NOT written eloquently at all. It told more than it showed, and it sounded more like a personal commentary then a beautiful and visceral essay. I spent a few weeks over the course of a couple months on it! \n\n* (Wrote another personal statement on my costco trips with my grandfather and learning from all the employees but scrapped it after I saw that a costco essay had gotten famous in the past... used the general idea for my Rice and Princeton essays though!) \n\nSupplements - 8/10: I worked a lot on these. Wrote about my interest in spatial rhetoric, the intersection between music and physics and how everything has rhythm, my work with bassoon reeds, my want to help with quality of life with those with vestibular dysfunction with biomedical engineering, disagreements in band, my eagle scout project, and my affinity for getting stuck in nets (definitely my favorite one). These were definitely more eloquently written!\n\n\n\n**Decisions**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Arizona State University RD\n* University of Arizona (Honors College) RD\n* Washington University in St. Louis (Ampersand Scholarship) RD\n* Emory University RD \n* University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Honors Carolina Program) RD\n* Rice University RD\n* Carnegie Mellon University (School of Computer Science WHATTT????)

I am so excited to meet everyone on campus and spend these next four years with changemakers, researchers, and artists. At Bulldog Days, I met such an amazing group of people (but over half are committing elsewhere :((( ), but I am so excited! It all works out :) \n\nI honestly did not (and still a lot of times don't ) think I'm T20 caliber. Like I mentioned before, the people I've met are the smartest, most accomplished people I've ever seen. Speaking at the UN, coke scholars, working with congress, developing AI algorithms (which I've always wanted to try!) winning national science fairs, and so much more, there are so many times where I feel like I am definitely not nearly where everyone else is, or didn't take advantage of my time. \n\nDuring high school, I've always wanted to get involved in starting a nonprofit or doing research but I never knew where to start. And, coming from a rural public high school with a huge emphasis on sports and technical education, I never really had much guidance or many opportunities made available or known. I could have definitely made my own though, and I feel that I definitely fell behind. I really hop to catch up in college because I want to become a changemaker and help those around me. Idk if it's imposter syndrome or if I really did just get lucky, but some of the other kids I've met are leagues beyond what I could have ever imagined was possible in high school. I really do wish I did more, whether that was research, AI development, or public policy initiatives, but I hope I'll have those opportunities in college! \n\nEither way, I am so thankful for all of the help I've received, for my decisions, and for the opportunities I have been offered, and I cannot wait for the next four :)\n\nIf you have any questions please let me know!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1k9gksa/im_scared_of_rubber_chickens_but_not_the_waitlist/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1k9gksa/im_scared_of_rubber_chickens_but_not_the_waitlist/", "upvotes": 43, "num_comments": 26, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "results"}

PLEASE HELP 🙏.", "selftext": "Hi everyone,  \nI'm really overwhelmed and would appreciate any advice.\n\nI’m a senior at a private school (subsidized by my mom's employment benefits) in Mongolia. I’m enrolled in the IB Diploma. I started off motivated and strong, but during Year 2 — especially with college applications and other pressures — I completely burned out. From October to January, I could barely function. I wasn’t able to finish my IAs properly, missed my TOK Essay deadline (even though I technically submitted it an hour before the IB deadline), and eventually was moved from Diploma to Certificate candidate. After mock exams, my predicted grade was around 25.\n\nSomehow, despite everything, I was accepted to NYU Shanghai — the only school I got into after applying to NYU, Stanford, Vanderbilt, Trinity (withdrawn because of IELTS delay), and Swarthmore.\n\nBut now I’m facing a lot of problems:\n\n* **NYU Shanghai doesn’t offer the majors I truly want** (Education Studies with teaching qualification or Psychology).\n* **The grant I received is $42,300, but the total cost is about $88,000 a year.** My family’s expected contribution is only \\~$10,000/year, but they expect me to somehow cover $43,000 per year. It’s financially impossible for us.\n* **NYU Shanghai requires final academic performance consistent with my application.** I’m about to fail my IB exams in Math, Chemistry, and Mandarin (SL), and only have some hope for English HL, Biology HL, and Econ HL.\n* **I want to defer** — to travel, work, heal, become financially independent — but deferral is subject to their approval, and I’m not sure they’ll approve me if I fail the full IB Diploma.\n* **I’m considering a gap year**: resit exams, retake SAT (aim for 1550+), do passion projects, intern, teach, move toward independence, and reapply broadly, but I’m scared about burning out again — especially without family support.\n* **Family pressure is huge.** I grew up without my parents (lived with my grandmother) and have always been pressured to overachieve to meet my mom’s expectations. Emotional support was (and still is) missing, and it’s making everything much harder.\n\nI'm stuck between:\n\n* Trying to beg NYU Shanghai for more aid + ask if graduating high school with a diploma (even failing IB) is enough.\n* Deferring NYU Shanghai (if they allow) to work and save — but risking that the school withdraws my offer due to my IB results.\n* Taking a full gap year, resitting IB exams, retaking SAT, applying again — but terrified of burnout without moral support.\n* Or just starting work immediately, trying to move out and moving on with my life.\n\nI’m exhausted and scared.  \nIs it realistic to hope for full recovery, self-study for 45 IB + 1550 SAT + build a strong gap year profile — **in 6-12 months** — without strong emotional support at home?  \nOr should I focus on financial independence first and rebuild slowly?\n\nAny advice would mean the world to me.

Helped me study for AP Gov, and knew her for 8 years. Pretty sure it was great.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Essays:**\n\n\n\n\n**Interviews:**\n \nThree — Georgetown, Yale and the sign-up interview for Washington and Lee.\n\n\n**Results:**\n\nAcceptances (All RD):\n\n1. Washington and Lee University (10K EFC) [EDI deferred ---> Accepted RD with LOCI)\n2. Colby College (9K EFC) [EDII Deferred  ---> Accepted RD with LOCI]\n3. Amherst College (3K EFC) ---> Committed\n\n\nWaitlists:\n\n1. Carleton College\n2. Yale College\n3. Bates College\n4. Georgetown University \n5. Dartmouth College \n\n\nRejections:\n\nAll other T30 LACs, HYPS, All other ivies, Duke, Vanderbilt\n\n\nAdditional information:\n\nIf you're an Indian international, male, need aid, want to major in STEM and are from a non feeder school, please understand the hyper competitive nature of admissions. You constantly see Indian males saying they got rejected everywhere or they didn't get any affordable offers, it's usually because of certain weaknesses in their applications.\n\n\n\n1. You **need 97+ in 9th and 10th,** **90+ in 11th** and **90+ in 12th midterms** with a **95+ predicted in 12th.** Yes, it is very difficult to maintain such high grades, especially with grade deflation in 11th and 12th mid-terms, but these are the best colleges on the planet—they want the best possible students. That is a very harsh reality.\n\n\n\n2. No matter your major, intellectual interests or favorite subjects, if you want to get into top schools with aid and you're doing CBSE or ISC in 11th and 12th, you **need PCM + CS/Econ/Biology/Psychology/Biotechnology/Any other academic subject.** Unless you have something very rare or special, having PCM + Physical Education or Informatics Practices or Fine arts or Music will kick you out of the running, because top colleges that give aid **highly value** course rigor, and being seen with easier subjects like P.Ed, IP and Fine Arts will make it clear that you wanted easy subjects to focus on PCM. That is exactly **not** the kind of student these top schools want.\nIf you have the Commerce or Humanities, **make sure to have Standard Mathematics in 11th and 12th,** otherwise you'll be seen to have low rigor and will be kicked out of the running academically. Also, CBSE **Applied Mathematics** is absolute BS. \n\n\n3. High SAT scores. Cannot stress this enough. If you're in dire need of aid, a 1550+ is an absolute must, especially if you're an Indian male in STEM. An 800 in Math is basically expected of you, and 750+ in EBRW is necessary to prove you are at the reading comprehension level that a rigorous liberal arts education will demand.\n\n\n4. AP Exams. Though not strictly necessary, but if you are like I was and had PCMB (Pure Science Stream) and wanted to major in non-STEM, having AP scores in subjects that demonstrate your academic interest in your intended major is very, very helpful. Almost all successful aid seekers who got into top schools like WASP LACs and Ivies **will have scores of 4 or 5 on multiple AP tests.** I definitely think part of the reason I got into Amherst was that inspite of me having only Sciences in my curriculum, I demonstrated proficiency in Humanities subjects via my AP tests. \n\n\n5. English Proficiency testing. I definitely do not recommend asking the colleges to waive English Proficiency tests by saying your school is English medium or having a high SAT EBRW sub-score. Yes the TOEFL and IELTS cost money, but please do take them. \n\nThe rule for the **TOEFL is having no less than 27 on each section**, and for **IELTS, no less than 8 on each section.**\n\n\n\nAll the Indians I see getting rejected everywhere don't have one or more of the above **unspoken requirements.**\n\n\nIt's actually not that hard to get into top schools with aid from India if you meet all of these benchmarks, because so few of the applicants from India meet them, especially the ones from non-feeders.\n\n\nECs have to be strong, but they are far more subjective in nature, and have to be related to what you want to do in college and you need to be passionate about them, because that is the only way you'll reflect well on them in essays.\n\n\nI was a Gov/Econ major, not STEM, but I had extremely strong STEM academics and testing, so I demonstrated proficiency in all aspects of a liberal arts curriculum, which is why I believe I was a successful applicant.\n\nI wish the best to all of you! I hope you all achieve your goals.\n\n\n\n**Note from me personally:** Ik my friend has a somewhat exclusionary, cynical, perfectionist and somewhat elitist worldview of how admissions work for applicants from India, but having seen recent admissions cycles, I'm unfortunately inclined to believe he's somewhat right 😭. I had so much less compared to him, and I was FAR from a perfect applicant, but I still got into Harvard.\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1k88e3m/indian_bags_lacs_against_all_odds/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1k88e3m/indian_bags_lacs_against_all_odds/", "upvotes": 17, "num_comments": 15, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|Art/Hum", "query_matched": "results"}

I had my Precalculus teacher for Freshman year Algebra as well, which I did well in, and she recommended me for summer Alg 2/Trig so I could take Calculus senior year. I got a D in Precalculus, but I worked really hard to raise it to a D since I was failing most of the semester, so I wanted her to write about how I’m a good, hard working, and persevering student. My Comp Gov & Politics teacher probably wrote a plain LOR. I didn’t talk much in that class, but she didn’t have anything bad to say and I got an A- in it.\n\n**Essays** \n\n* I wrote about my health issues, extracurriculars, and identity. I emphasized challenges I’ve faced and how I’ve overcome them. I spoke on how much I value my extracurriculars & the work I put into them. For UC Berkeley, I wrote an essay about Precalculus and how I worked hard & persevered to pass the class. I love writing and know my essays helped my applications a lot. My main common app essay had a typo (!!) in the first paragraph, which I didn’t notice until after I applied to a few schools, including U of Michigan.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n* interviewed for Harvard & Fairfield.

My only ‘dream’ school was Harvard. I honestly thought U of Michigan was a sports school that just happened to be ranked #2 for Psychology and the first time I heard 'Go Blue' was admitted students' day. I recommend not comparing yourself as much to others. If I knew any of these college admissions reddit pages existed when I was applying to colleges, I’d be a lot more stressed out and scared. If I posted my stats, I doubt anyone would say I could get into UC Berkeley or U of Michigan. I focused on extracurriculars I genuinely enjoyed and took classes that I knew I could handle and would help me stand out (ex. A B+ in Honors Ancient Greek is more impressive than an A in Honors Spanish; 1 semester of statistics was better for me mentally than Calculus or AP Statistics). U of Michigan lets people see their applications & what admissions officers wrote, but I've decided to keep it a mystery & recognize that all my hard work played a part. All applications besides the UC schools were free for me, so I applied wherever I wanted.

Head of School's List: High Honors & High Honors w/Distinction **(9, 10, 11, 12)**\n4. National Honor Society **(11)**\n5. Fine, Creative, & Performing Arts (School-based) **(11)**\n\n***Letters of Recommendation***\n\n1. **HS Counselor (7/10):** Above relationship w/my counselor. Saw me more than just a student (struggled w/balancing work & school). Huge procrastinator in his Chem classes though.\n2. **Latin (8/10):** Would always actively participate in her classes and had a great relationship overall. She's also the advisor for Interact Club.\n3. **Environmental Science (4/10)**: Did well in his classes and had a good relationship. Letter was decent- didn't reveal much about me except for some qualities and just listed my activities. Didn't have him til my senior year besides 7th & 8th grade science so I wasn't expecting anything strong.\n4. **Fine Arts (9.5/10):** Absolutely love her classes. She's so flexible w/whatever I wanted to do and always supported my ideas w/o judgement.\n5. **Manager @ house museum (3/10):** Incredibly nice & understanding but her letter was less than half a page 💀.\n\n***Interviews***\n\n* **Bowdoin (7/10):** Idk it was casual but nothing was clicking. Their interviews are curated to be like a conversation and not an interview so I wasn't that stressed. Discussed a lot about the perks of what a liberal arts education offers.\n* **Smith College: (5/10)**: Stuttered so bad and was not at all prepared. I felt jittery but the interviewer was nice. We did talk about one of my project involving art and science and I think that really captured her attention but overall I stumbled over my answers a lot.\n* **Bryn Mawr (NA/10)**: I wouldn't know cos I messed up the time zone and ended up missing it...💀\n\n***Essays***\n\n* **Personal Statement (9.5/10):** Wrote about my work experience at my parents' restaurant since 9th grade and how it prevented me from exploring my other interests on my bucket list. Reflected on how much I had scarified my childhood as being the older sibling and what I was enthusiastic in doing to cultivate new opportunities in college that I missed in HS.\n* **Supplemental Essays (8.5/10):** Mainly revolved around my passion for combining art and science. Specifically tailored to fit the school's offerings and what I would do to take advantage of it.\n* **UC PIQs (7/10):** They were alright. Maybe 1-2 out of 4 were actually good, but the rest sounded funny now that I look back at it.\n\nI literally procrastinated. Wrote them around 1-2 weeks before the deadline. I did recycle them as much as I could, but I did schedule myself to space out the supplementals and how many I would write in a day (helped a lot w/stress).\n\n***Decisions (all RD):***\n\n**Acceptance:**\n\n* **Bates College** (13%)\n* **Bryn Mawr** (31%)\n* **Rhodes College** (50%)- *Founders Scholarship*: $38k/yr + Likely Letter\n* **Rutgers** (66%)\n* **Smith College** (20%)\n* **Temple** (83%)- *Dean's Scholarship:* $18k/yr + *Conwell Scholarship:* $2k/yr\n* **Union College** (44%)- *Henle Scholarship*: $34k/yr\n* **Pittsburgh** (50%)- $5k/yr scholarship\n* **UC Davis** (42%)\n\n**Waitlisted:**\n\n* **Grinnell** (11%)\n* **NYU** (7.7%)\n* **Santa Clara** (44%)- this was so random wtf *(Withdrew)*\n* **UC Irvine** (28%) *(Withdrew)*\n* **Wesleyan** (19%)\n* **William & Mary** (36%) *(Withdrew)*\n\n**Rejected**\n\n* **Bowdoin** (7%)- literally my dream school :(\n* **UCLA** (8.6%)\n* **Vanderbilt** (6%)\n* **University of Maryland- College Park** (45%)- APPLY EA PLS. I didn't realize they accept 95% of its students from the EA pool, where RD has only a 5% chance. Don't make the mistake I did.\n\n**Committed to:** >!Rhodes College!! Go Lynx!!<\n\n***Reflection***\n\n* Unfortunately, I won’t be able to attend my top two schools (Smith & Bates) due to tuition being around $90–100k/year. I find it difficult to justify that level of expense for a bachelor's degree, especially since I plan to pursue med school afterwards . Ngl this shit sucks and ik I'm not the only one to make such decisions, but my mind can't wrap around how different my college experience would be if I were to attend either. Nonetheless, I'm really excited to start my new journey at Rhodes College and can't wait to start this fall!\n\n***Advice***\n\n* Going into this process had me scared nonetheless. I was always under the impression that my activities and accolades weren't up to par compared to those with top-tier research experience and nonprofits donating XYZ amount. The only advice I can't strongly emphasize enough is that: **ESSAYS MATTER**.\n* When writing your personal statement/supps. remember that **authenticity & character** carry more value to your application than any test scores and activities can. **If you have a story, tell it, don't suppress it.**\n* Have people proofread your essays!! I didn't out of fear of showing my vulnerability.\n* **DON'T LIMIT YOURSELF.** I never thought that I was competitive enough for some colleges and so I wouldn't apply to them out of fear of rejection. Don't be like that. No ones holding you back but yourself, have no regrets.\n\nIf you guys have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1lwgc8y/asians_bags_some_of_her_lacs/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1lwgc8y/asians_bags_some_of_her_lacs/", "upvotes": 24, "num_comments": 4, "flair": "3.8+|Other|STEM", "query_matched": "decision"}

(summer after junior year/12) Summer research at nearby lower tier ish public school (not T200). More biomedical leaning, but I did do some cheme stuff. Like 12 hours per week for most weeks of the summer? Didn't get my name on any papers or publish anything or do any competitions with the research, but I definitely contributed a decent amount to procedure stuff and learned a lot.\n2. (11-12) Co-president of club tutoring at nearby lower income elementary school in my area over the summer. Got like 80+ hours over two summers (different tutors went on different days). Idk how much of a measurable impact I demonstrated to AOs, but I def like to think I made some impact on the kids.\n3. (9-12) School DnD club cofounder and copresident (like 3-5 hours per week probably?). We met to play and learn about DnD, including some weekend sessions over discord. I organized a book drive through the club junior year.\n4. (9-12) Soccer. I absolutely sucked, but it was a major time commitment, especially during summer and fall. I was JV first three years and mostly rode the bench on varsity senior year. Won some awards.\n5. (9-12) Hockey. I sucked at this even worse than soccer (freshman year was only my first year playing).  JV all 4 years.\n6. (9-12) Quiz bowl. I was the captain of my school's team all four years, and at a bunch of local NAQT tournaments I managed to place really high individually a few times. We had mixed success as a team but managed to qualify for nationals senior year. Like 3-4 hours per week average?\n7. (9-12) Debate. Did congressional first 3 years but then got fed up with being judged on speaking skills and did a little bit of public forum senior year. Invested less time as I got older and did other ECs. Went to states a few times and did meh, did pretty well at a few district national qualifying tournaments tho.\n8. (9-12) International cultures club. Co-president my senior year. I did a ton of presentations about BOSNIA!!! and some presentations about other countries. Not a massive time commitment during weeks when I wasn't presenting.\n9. (11-12) FTC robotics. Finance/outreach captain and I organized some service opportunities. Also was on a council thingy outside my school focused on FIRST robotics outreach.\n10. (9-12) Engineering experiential learning thingy through my school. I ended up doing a lot of like kinda lowkey beginner-level ish coding projects (and a couple bigger ones) for this (along with logging EC #1 for this).\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*\n\n1. School math department award (10, 11)\n2. National Merit finalist, 1520 PSAT (eventually won a scholarship, but finalist for RD and I think EA was semifinalist?) (11)\n3. AP Scholar (10), with Distinction (11)\n4. Local book award thingy from a college's alumni association (11)\n5. URochester Bausch and Lomb Science Excellence Award (11)\n\nAlso, over my first 3 years I managed to win awards in every subject department that gave awards at my school and I included that on my resume for all the schools that asked for resumes, so some schools saw that.\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*\n\nOne was from a math and physics teacher I had all 4 years and the other was from an English teacher I had for the first 3 years. I have no clue what they wrote, but they both like me and know me and my personality quite well from class (I participated a lot but also goofed off within reason semi-regularly), so the letters were probably really good if I had to guess. I won't bother using a numerical rating cuz I genuinely don't know, but I'd guess they'd both be very high. My school college counselor also wrote one that was probably really good as well.\n\nI lowkey realize now I could have asked my research mentor from EC #1 for one, and he probably would have said yes and wrote some solid stuff, but I genuinely didn't know that was something I could do lol. Also, I don't think he got to really know me quite well personally because I was kind of shy and reserved cuz I was so worried about messing up during my time in his lab, so Idk maybe I didn't miss out on much.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*\n\nMIT (5-6/10)- My first interview, and it wasn't a complete bomb but I do think I stumbled and stuttered a lot in answering his why major follow up questions.  I mentioned some research projects of certain professors, but I wasn't able to go into too much detail just cuz my only research experience at the time was in more BME leaning stuff anyway. I answered other questions pretty well. The interviewer was a middle-aged guy with some important sounding job title in some important industry, and he was nice enough but I was still intimidated.\n\nRice (9/10)- Might've stumbled once or twice, but the interviewer was a current student, which made it less intimidating.  There was like one joke I made that didn't land, but other jokes did land, and I think I vibed with the interviewer anyway.\n\nUPenn \"alumni convo\"- This was a \"not evaluated\" \"alumni conversation\" so I won't bother giving it a rating, but I still came prepared. He was a really chill middle aged former history major. He asked if there was anything I wanted him to briefly mention in a little note to the AOs, and I mentioned a fiction writing competition I did well in for funsies but didn't include in my ECs section.\n\n**Essays**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\n\nMy commonapp essay was about how I have a crap ton of interests and how I work to sustain them over time instead of just skimming Wikipedia and hyperfixating for 2 weeks before completely abandoning them. I used an extended metaphor about the drug I worked with in my research EC and also had a neat lil extended gimmick throughout the entire essay about how the acronym for the drug I worked with is the same as the acronym for a European political party (I know it sounds weird but trust it makes sense in context, especially cuz politics is one of the many interests I mentioned having).\n\nI would definitely say my commonapp essay was a strong part of my app. I didn't use an outside private college counselor or anything, but the people who I asked to read it liked it and I think it checks the boxes of advice I read online.  It was def quite unique and included a lot of things about my personality.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n***Acceptances:***\n\n* Notre Dame (REA; their REA lets you apply to other privates EA, just not ED) +25k merit scholarship (free with needs based aid)\n* Georgia Tech (OOS) (EA2)\n* Purdue (OOS) (EA) +10k merit\n* University of Southern California (EA) deferred -> accepted spring term\n* UT Austin (OOS) (EA)\n* Rice (RD) +30k merit scholarship (free with needs based aid)\n* Vanderbilt (RD) +6k merit crescere aude scholarship thingy for summer research or study abroad\n* University of Pennsylvania (RD) COMMITTED!!!\n* state flagship (safety) and in state public even safer safety, both with decent merit money but still kinda expensive (EA)\n\n***Waitlists:***\n\n* Northworstern (RD) (remained on it initially - didn't renew interest in like June?)\n* Johns Oppkins (RD) (still on it?)\n* Cornhell (RD) (waitlisted -> rejected)\n* WashedU St. Louis (RD) (declined offer)\n* Colby Jack Cheese College (RD) (declined offer) (listed environmental computation and astrophysics as majors I was interested in)\n* University of Midchigan (OOS) (EA) (deferred -> waitlisted -> declined offer)\n\n***Rejections:***\n\n* MIT (EA) deferred -> rejected\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*(anything of relevance)*\n\nIt isn't lost on me how lucky I am to have had all these options, and I'm insanely grateful for everyone who helped me get here and all the opportunities I had.\n\nAt the end, it came down to UPenn, Rice, and ND, and I appealed my aid at UPenn.  I was ready to commit to Rice until the UPenn aid appeal came back pretty successful (still far from free tho).  My Mom was probably the main driving force for why I ended up choosing UPenn. She wanted me to be closer to home (neither Philly nor Houston is particularly close, but Philly is def the closer of the two) and she was outraged by me considering a school so far away. She pressured me to take UPenn, also because of the Ivy name brand, and I figured, y'know, if my parents are generous enough to foot most of that bill and they're willing to pay more for me to be close to home, then I'll take that.\n\nALSO: my main piece of advice for people in my general income range. Don't apply to so many OOS publics. They will not give you enough aid; I wish I didn't apply to UT Austin and take the spot of someone actually willing to pay 70k for that.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1lvndvl/halfbosniak_yvl_carti_glazer_cheme_lands_ivy_and/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1lvndvl/halfbosniak_yvl_carti_glazer_cheme_lands_ivy_and/", "upvotes": 23, "num_comments": 8, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "decision"}

I wrote about crossing my first day and how it seemed like a hollywood movie cause it seemed nice compared to them mexican highschools. Another one was about teaching and me learning on how help others better. Another one is about how my greatest skill was perseverance and that i had given up much on trying in Mexico since theres barely any opportunities there but when i arrived here opportunities were thrown left and right, I wrote that I had found the meaning in trying. And the last essay was about the passion for electronics since I was a kid.\n\n**RD**\n\n*Acceptances: all RD* \n\n* UC Berkeley EECS Accepted (Comitted!!!! yay)\n* UCSD CSE Accepted\n* Cal Poly Slo EE Accepted\n* UC Riverside CSE Accepted\n* UC Davis CSE Accepted\n* UC Irvine CSE Accepted\n* SDSU CS Accepted\n\n*Rejections: all RD*\n\n* UCLA EE Rejected\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n**I just recently realized that I got accepted as OOS since AB 540 is resident only for tuition cost**\n\nI did this post cause because I can tell you guys see the elephant in the room. I didnt apply to ANY common app colleges and that is honestly a regret that I might carrying to the grave. please guys dont autoreject yourselves, only applying to berkeley is like the worst decision I ever made because thats the only reach/target school there is here, If I had gotten rejected at Berkeley I would have like gone insane I genuinely dont know why I before I applied I was like Im 100% getting to berkeley so I just assumed since like 10th grade I was attending there. I didnt even THINK of the ivy league, its genuinely the most stupid decision I ever made, pls dont be me. I got lucky tho and now Im a happy bear, so good ending!. \n\nTLDR I was overconfident I was 100% landing Berkeley and underconfident there was no way I landed Stanford/MIT/CMU/pton, I didnt even shoot my shot at the ivy league so I got a cliffhanger there as well.

I was always very active in class and thoroughly enjoyed our conversations on various pieces of French literature and culture. Super sweet lady, she definitely wrote a fantastic recommendation. 10/10\n\nEnglish 10/AP Language teacher: He also taught me for two years and thus definitely had great insight as to how I grew as a writer. I was always actively engaged in class and made an effort to reach out to him on improving my writing skills, which I’m sure he appreciated. Although he was a tough teacher, he was always very encouraging so I’m 100% sure he wrote a great LOR. 10/10 \n\n**Interviews**\n\n**USMA:** Interviewed by a current cadet. I think it went well, I answered honestly and concisely, but it was my first interview so I was definitely feeling nervous. 8/10 \n\n**Georgetown:** Interviewed by an older alumna. She was a nice lady, studied at the SFS as an international student. We bonded over being Eastern European and meeting people from diverse backgrounds (my high school happens to have a good number of international students). It was a zoom meeting though and my connection was rough which made conversation hard to flow easily. 7/10 \n\n**College of the Holy Cross:** Interviewed by an older alumna. Also a zoom meeting, but connection was better so no awkward pauses. Super sweet, we talked about volunteering and community engagement, but I didn’t really feel a “click.” 7/10\n\n**Middlebury:** Interviewed by an older alumna. Again, zoom meeting, so conversation wasn’t all that smooth. I hardly remember what we talked about, which probably goes to show how the interview as a whole went. 6/10 \n\n**Connecticut College:** Interviewed by a current student. She was so nice! We talked a lot about volunteering, study abroad, and community service. It was quick but we covered a lot of ground. 9/10\n\n**Dartmouth:** THIS INTERVIEW. This was the craziest one. It was on zoom and lasted well over an hour (which shocked me because my other ones were about 30 minutes). He was a cool guy, a recent alum who majored in Political Science, and came very, very prepared. He kept asking so many questions, some of which caught me off guard. Probably could have done better. 6/10\n\n**Princeton:** Interviewed by an older alum, math major. He was nice enough but pretty awkward. I’d ask him a question to get a better feel of the school but he couldn't answer any of them (couldn’t remember?). But I nailed his questions. 7/10 \n\n**Yale:** Interviewed by a recent alumna. This was on zoom but it went surprisingly well. It was short but we covered solid questions, which I believe I gave great answers to. 10/10\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal statement: I basically used my love for writing to describe various parts of my identity: cultural heritage, faith, desire to serve my community, etc. The idea was that writing was the means through which I made sense of the world. I worked on it over the summer (\\~1 week) and made some changes to it with my counselor. Admittedly, I am a pretty good writer, so I think this was definitely one of my strong points. 10/10\n\nSupplementals: Used them to dive more deeply into the topics I mentioned in my personal statement. I recycled many of them, but common themes were my family, school community, and love of history. I had a little trouble with some of the “Why Us?” essays but with some research they turned out OK. 9/10\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Yale University RD >!(Committed!)!<\n* Brown University RD\n* Wesleyan University RD\n* Brandeis University RD (Humanities Fellowship + International Business Scholars program)\n* University of Connecticut RD (Law Honors Program)\n* Connecticut College RD\n* Williams College RD\n* Hamilton College RD\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* College of the Holy Cross RD\n* Georgetown University EA → deferred → waitlisted RD\n* Middlebury College RD\n* Boston College RD\n* Fairfield University EA → deferred → waitlisted RD\n* Amherst College RD\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Harvard University RD\n* Dartmouth College RD\n* Princeton University RD\n\n**Reflection:**\n\nI locked in during high school, but I have to admit I also feel lucky and blessed to have a legacy connection and ROTC scholarship at Yale. Those two factors definitely nudged me in the right direction there.\n\nHowever, the point I want to emphasize is to tell YOUR story, write honestly, and be passionate. If you’re a rising senior, take the time to sit and stare at a blank Google Doc and think about what you loved doing throughout high school– don’t cater or try to craft your story in a particular way! For other high school students, don’t waste time pursuing activities you lack the passion for. I tried doing a science fair my sophomore year and absolutely HATED the experience– never did it again. I preferred humanities classes over the sciences, which is why I never took a physics course in my life. Was it stressful, blowing off activities or classes that would “look good” for college? Yes! But I was happier in the end and got to explore who I really was.\n\nAnd look, if you’re stressing about accolades or test scores, I genuinely feel that the essays and LORs make all the difference. If done right, they can capture small essences of who you are, so even if you think you’re “subpar” in other areas, the essays will make up for it. Test scores and all that jazz are simply benchmarks to see if you can handle the workload at the college, not definitions of who you are as a person. \n\nLet me know if you have any questions!

Was fortunate enough to get to study what I wanted without any financial stress which is a huge privilege to say and set me up to do what I’m currently doing today.

National Merit commendation\n\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nTeacher recs - knew both of my teachers personally. They knew me as both a person and a student. For one of my teachers, it was their first year teaching. Don’t know if that made it easier/harder for them to write it.\n\nCounselor rec - I’ve built up such a great relationship with my counselor and their colleagues. I’ve even helped one of their colleagues sell sneakers. Beyond just the college app process, my counselors have been great mentors. I’m sure the rec letter was great.\n\n\n**Interviews**\n\n* scholarship interview for presidential scholarship @ Buffalo might have been my most textbook perfect interview ever. My interviewer happened to be heavily involved with fashion (one of my core ECs), and I was able to connect with them, as well as improvise very well. I reminded the interviewer of their son and we bonded a little bit over that. I wrote my common app essay about CitiBikes in NYC, and their son also happened to be a huge Citibiker themselves. \n\n* Scholarship interview @Stony Simons also went very well. It was a group interview where I took lead in the assignment. They also put me on aux and all of the staff and alumni really enjoyed my taste and were vibing with me in the waiting room with the other interviewees.\n\n* Did not get a Yale interview. Knew I was pretty much cooked.\n\n\n**Essays**\n\n* personal statement - felt quite confident in it. Wrote about the challenges of bicycling through NYC. Lots of vivid details and imagery, went for a heavy show not tell approach. Speaks to who I am as a person and coming outside of my bubble, becoming exploratory and loving my city. Didn’t mention what I want to study or my ECs at all.\n\n* Supplementals - recycled a lot of the themes, but really went in detail about each schools, the curriculum, clubs, and professors. Heavily leaned into my fashion background for some of them. It’s nice to present yourself as a little more artistically driven, instead of as an average geeky engineering applicant.\n\n\n\n**Decisions**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Rutgers University Honors College RD\n* SUNY Binghamton University EA\n* SUNY Stony Brook University EA\n* The Cooper Union RD (free tuition 3 years)\n* Syracuse University RD (negotiated down to half off full tuition+board)\n* Boston University RD\n* New York University RD\n* SUNY University at Buffalo Honors College EA (+ full-ride Presidential Scholarship. Only awarded to 15 students in each graduating class)\n\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Northeastern University RD (Accepted)\n* Cornell University RD (Accepted and committed!)\n* University of Michigan RD (withdrew)\n* Georgia Tech RD (withdrew)\n\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Yale University RD\n* Columbia University ED (So thankful now in retrospect lol. I applied before a lot of the heavy BS happened)\n* Johns Hopkins University RD \n* Carnegie Mellon University RD\n* CUNY Macaulay Honors College RD\n* Stony Brook Simons scholarship (although accepted to SBU)\n* Boston University Honors College (although accepted to BU)\n\n\nTakeaways:\n\nStandardized tests are not the end all be all of the college application process. Work heavily on your essays and create a narrative that tells these admissions officers not just about your academic accomplishments or contributions to your community, but also about your nuanced interests and character. How people write their essays in one night is beyond me. Spend some more time on them!\n\nPlease try and build good relationships with your counselors. I’m on texting terms with mine, and they can do so much as mentors in life as well as playing crucial roles in the college application process. Being very well connected with your counselor will make them more inclined to vouch on your behalf, say when you’re waitlisted at your dream school.\n\nLastly, I’m happy that I kept fighting until the end, especially when it came to scholarship money. Even though I can afford most of these schools at their sticker prices, I nonetheless tried my best to negotiate the tuition down. Some schools didn’t bother picking up the phone, while others heard me out and worked with me.

I didn’t really have time to study for the SAT senior year. I was focused on getting my applications in and keeping up with my AP classes. Northeastern gave me the best financial aid, even better than my in-state schools if I stayed home and commuted, so I’m very grateful to be attending.\n\nI honestly thought I had SLO. I appealed the rejection right away but didn’t get in. Same with Purdue, though I probably should’ve applied EA. Tufts might’ve gone better if I did the optional interview, but after my Harvard interview I didn’t feel confident, and by the time I was ready, I missed the Tufts deadline. Middlebury was my best interview by far and we actually connected, but I didn’t get in there either.\n\nMost of the reach schools I applied to were ones my parents were excited about. I had fee waivers for everything, so I just went for it. Looking back, I should’ve applied to more schools in the T30–T50 range. I’m first-gen, had no one in my family to guide me, and didn’t really have an active private college counselor all the way. I mostly relied on CollegeVine and online stuff, which didn’t end up being that helpful. There were too many supplementals to go deep on each one.\n\nMSU, Drexel, and ASU gave me almost no aid and expected near full price, so I ruled them out quickly.

(Prompt was: what is something you know about yourself to be true) \n\nBennington: I think I wrote about trying theater for the first time in my senior year (prompt was just to write about something you created) \n\nSpelman: I wrote about changing the world by taking small steps; and how conversations and movements are cumulative despite how much of history is taught to teach the opposite (prompt was something like what approach would you make if you wanted to make lasting, large impact, change)\n\n\nDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD):\n\nAcceptances:\n\n* University of Puget sound  (EA) w/ Dean’s Scholarship \n         * Bioethics major applicant \n\n* U of Alaska Fairbanks (rolling) w/ a 20k scholarship and I qualify for in state tuition (WUE is goated)\n          * Environmental and climate change major applicant \n\n* St. Mary’s College (Norte Dame, Indiana) (EA) w/ around half off of tuition (Le Man’s Scholar I think?)\n         * Sociology major applicant\n\nWaitlists (opted to go on all waiting lists, submitted a LOCI for Reed and Scripps):\n\n* Reed College (ED)—>not sure yet\n        * I also got accepted as a senior      scholar \n       *  undecided major applicant\n\n* Scripps College (RD) —>not sure as of yet\n      * Africana Studies major Applicant \n\n* UConn (RD) (Storrs  Campus) —-> denied\n         * I got in as a spring admit, but I just wanted to go in fall so I opted for the waiting list\n         * Pathobiology major applicant \n\n* Bennington College (applied to their ‘late decision’ option in May) ——> accepted w/ 45k a year scholarship \n          * Environmental  Sciences, Political Science, and History applicant \n\nRejections:\n\n* Bryn Mawr (RD, may have been late? Kinda forgot I applied here)\n        * Anthropology major applicant \n\n* Spelman College (RD) (apparently really hard to get fin aid, so probably for the best) \n        * Africana studies major applicant \n\nConclusion:\n\nAnyways, to make a long story short, I ended up committing to a nearby community college! I was committed to Bennington for a hot minute getting off the waitlist, but the cost of attendance was still like $30k+ and they refused to give more aid upon appeal, so I unenrolled. I have a twin sibling committed to going to a really prestigious college that has a cost of attendance of 92k a year with little aid, and with the financial strain that I know this will put on everyone in my family, I just decided to pull back, stay at home, complete my associates degree for little to nothing, and really hone in on what I really want with my education/career path to be before transferring to a 4-year institution!\n\nAnyways, thank you for reading this long yap session, and I hope this brings comfort to someone with a non-traditional college application experience in the future!! 🫶🏾🫶🏾", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1l6zzzm/girl_who_forgot_to_register_for_the_sat_three/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1l6zzzm/girl_who_forgot_to_register_for_the_sat_three/", "upvotes": 64, "num_comments": 5, "flair": "3.4+|Other|Other", "query_matched": "decision"}

National community service award for health equity org\n4. Regional/National community service award for health equity org\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n**APUSH teacher/Mentor:** Incredibly close with her. We've had many long conversations about my personal life, college app journey, interests, and community impact work. She was my coach/advisor for a 1-year leadership program we did together, and we even traveled to another state together. She also inspired my AP Research topic, since we have lots of similar interests. 10/10\n\n**AP Seminar teacher:** Definitely liked me as a student, but not too close. Known for being very particular about who they write letters for, so I'm sure it was really well-written. I'd assume they wrote about intellectual curiosity and community work I mentioned in my brag sheet. 7/10\n\n**Interviews**\n\n**Yale:** Interviewed by a cardiologist who received his Master's of Public Health from Yale. Not very conversational, so I was honestly surprised at the acceptance. Asked pretty generic questions, but he seemed impressed by my community service work. 8/10\n\n**Harvard:** Got lucky and got a recent grad who's an alum of my school and had the same interests as well. Was really conversational since we shared common interests and she seemed impressed by my social entrepreneurship work since she does similar health equity work. She kept asking really difficult, philosophical questions that I think I answered well, but def could've been more concise. 7/10\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App: Tied my lived experiences with family care-taking to my passions. Used part of my name as a vehicle to explain my love for the unknown (in a way that conveys intellectual curiosity) and how I'm driven by inherent purpose to define myself through my actions (i.e., servicing and advocating for others). In terms of personality, I think it showed reflection, vulnerability, empathy, drive, and how I'm people-oriented.\n\nSupps: Before writing, I thought of 3-5 traits that I wanted to convey (that weren't already emphasized in my personal statement) and centered my supps around them to make my app more story-focused and cohesive. I honestly wrote lots of them last minute and submitted the first draft (don't do that..), but I think it enabled my original ideas and voice to shine without overpolishing them. In all of them, I connected my lived experiences (i.e., with family, where I live) to my passions and used it to 1) tell stories about why I'm interested in things and 2) implicitly show my personality and way of seeing and thinking about the communities around me.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Yale (RD)\n* Northwestern (RD)\n* USC (EA -> deferred -> RD)\n* Williams (RD)\n* University of Washington-Seattle (RD)\n* UIUC (EA)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Harvard (RD)\n* Stanford (RD)\n* Northeastern (EA)\n* BU (RD)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* None\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nBiggest advice would be to TELL A STORY.

I was super excited to go found amazing roommates, just toured recently, and honestly liked the campus a lot. It’s close to home (I’m from the Bay Area), the food scene nearby is great, and I’d be able to go to concerts and events since Sacramento is only ~25 minutes away. I also love that I already have a solid living situation lined up.\n\nBUT… I just got a surprisingly generous financial aid offer from my dream school Syracuse University and now I don’t know what to do.\n\nAt Syracuse, I was accepted into Economics at the Maxwell School (which I hear is a really good program). My first-choice majors were business (Whitman) or communications (Newhouse), but I’ve heard it’s pretty difficult to transfer into those schools, so I’d probably have to stick with something else in Maxwell which I’m open to trying.\n\n\nHere’s what’s making the decision so hard:\n\nSyracuse Pros:\n\t•\tIt’s been my dream school for a while I hyped it up so much.\n\t•\tMaxwell is a strong school, even if it’s not what I originally applied for.\n\t•\tAMAZING school spirit something I really want in a college experience.\n\t•\tSmaller class sizes.\n\t•\tStrong alumni network, great for future opportunities.\n\t•\tIf I can transfer into Whitman or Newhouse, those programs are amazing.\n\nSyracuse Cons:\n\t•\tIt snows a LOT (remember, I’m from California ).\n\t•\tIt’s literally across the country, far from home and family.\n\t•\tNot near any big cities no off-campus concerts/events unless it’s on campus or at the Dome.\n\t•\tYou pretty much need a car to get around.\n\t•\tHeard the diversity isn’t great, and the food kind of sucks.\n\n\n\nUC Davis Pros:\n\t•\tClose to home, which means I can visit family easily.\n\t•\tAlready found great roommates and feel somewhat settled.\n\t•\tGood food options nearby, and concerts/events are easy to access in the area.\n\t•\tFamiliar environment, and a major city (Sacramento) is close.\n\n(also davis is higher ranked at #33 i believe vs syracuse #77 i think)\n\nUC Davis Cons:\n\t•\tBusiness and comm programs are not as strong as Syracuse.\n\t•\tBig class sizes.\n\t•\tNot a super strong school spirit vibe.\n\t•\tDavis is a total bike town, and uh… I don’t know how to ride a bike (but i can learn) 😭\n\n\n\nSo yeah… I’m kind of stuck. I always thought I’d go to Syracuse if I got the chance, and now that it’s (unexpectedly) on the table, I’m scared to give up Davis, especially with how much is already falling into place there.\n\nWould love to hear thoughts from anyone who’s been in a similar position should I stay with the safer, more convenient choice? Or go all in on the dream school that might be more of a risk?\n\nAny advice is appreciated ", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1l3v6rh/uc_davis_or_syracuse/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1l3v6rh/uc_davis_or_syracuse/", "upvotes": 2, "num_comments": 8, "flair": "3.4+|Other|Other", "query_matched": "decision"}

Don’t do clubs for the sake of doing clubs, but do something because **you want** to do it. Also look into merit scholarships like Johnson and Richmond, a full ride is incredible value and there are more out there than you might think!

My kiddo goes to a competitive bay area school, applied CS/CE to most colleges. First about the kiddo. Kiddo is hardworking, wants to do good in life, but does need a push every now and then, has a social life/fun with a small group of close friends. So not super shy, but not exactly very outgoing, more on the shyer side.\n\nDecided on UMD CE (about 65K/year, did not get into CS at UMD). Just yesterday was contacted by SCU (CS+CE) with a \\~25K aid, bringing down the cost to \\~40K (maybe +5K). Also specifically got into CS at UCSC (45K). Till now we thought we were done with discussions over and over again and settled on UMD. Now this opens the topic once again. Listing what we feel are pros and cons. The costs shared below are cost of attendance, not just tuition.\n\n1> UMD (CE) - 65K - Pros - Great college, prestigious, good ranking, opportunities in DC area, will give more exposure to life outside bay area and hopefully will help personal growth\n\nCons - Large class sizes, may not get courses as easily, far from home, completely on their own (THIS CAN BE BOTH GOOD OR BAD)\n\n2> SCU (CS+CE) - 40-45K - Pros - Small class sizes, will stay at home (which is also a big con), better connection with profs due to smaller student/faculty ratio, aid and commuter option makes it affordable\n\nCons - Not the usual college experience since commuter (hopefully we don’t do helicoptering), not as prestigious as UMD, not sure how well companies look at SCU opposed to UMD\n\n3> UCSC (CS) - 45K - Pros - Still a UC, though much lower ranked than UMD. Close to home, but far enough to stay at college. I believe the UC name still carries weight. \n\nCons - Large class sizes, not easy to get classes, housing situation in Santa Cruz overall difficult/pricey starting 2nd year, still quite close to home, so no real difference in environment\n\nPlease share your thoughts/personal experiences with any of these 3 colleges. ON A DEADLINE TO RESPOND. Also don't know if I am overthinking about the \"whole college experience\" thing.

My school really preped me for the thing that matters most in college admissions: being unique. Think about it, 10s of thousands of students fighting for such few seats you need to be different. Everyone has the basic ec's like FBLA, DECA, NHS. Beyond the 4.0 GPA and a 1560 SAT, I poured most of my time into building an organization that raised over $20,000 in under a year, partnered with Fortune 500 companies and Ivy League schools, and even got featured on Fox News. We’ve grown to 15 high school chapters and 2 collegiate chapters, and I’m still working on expanding it across states and even internationally. Alongside that, I interned in finance, started an investing platform, held leadership roles in multiple clubs, and did research at both a T20 and local program. Competitions like Wharton and the Fed Challenge were also big pieces of my story. If there’s one reflection I’d share, it’s that Stern (and top finance schools in general) really look for evidence that you can apply business concepts beyond the classroom. For me, the nonprofit was that differentiator, and it might be the perfect thing for anyone interested in leadership and finance to get involved in—I’m always happy to help others start a chapter at their school so let me know.

I was the only AIME qualifier at our school for 4 years straight and one of the only people she's ever taught who even qualified for it. She didn't love that I turned in work late a lot but it's ok.\n* Physics teacher (9.5/10): I was one of only two students in the entire school who scored a 5 on the AP Physics Mechanics exam (cuz he was so bad that he barely taught 3/4 of the content by the time the exam came around). He's an extremely fun a philosophical man so his rec was definitely \"quirky\". He values smarts a lot over hard work which is probably why he liked me so much.\n\n**essays:**\n\n* common app (9.5/10): Wrote about my mom needing brain surgery and how I needed to step up for my family because of it. Yes it was a sob story and made my english teacher cry.\n* supplementals (Varying from 5-9/10): The generic \"why us\" and \"why major\" essays and stuff were pretty solid. A lot of the rest were pretty mid except for Yale, Duke, and Cornell which I really tryharded on and had high hopes for.\n\n**interviews:**\n\n* Georgetown and Harvard were extremely mid (they were basically uninterested in me or anything I had to say).\n* MIT: literally the best interview of my entire life. Nearly 3 hours and the guy was loving every second of it. Dude legit wrote down like 10 pages worth of notes and emailed me the next week saying how much he loved writing my rec.\n* Yale: I think the guy liked me and thought I was \"smart\" but the interviewer kept trying to find out my political views and I could tell he was very republican based on his viewpoints. I tried as much as I could to seem neutral but maybe he just wanted to see how well I'm able to handle disagreements in order to fit into Yale well?? I didn't exactly \"debate\" but by the end we both knew each other's views on the current administration quite well.\n\n*Schools:*\n\n* Brown\n* CMU (applied as CS major)\n* Cornell\n* Duke\n* Emory\n* Georgetown\n* GTech (applied as CS major) (ea)\n* Harvard\n* Hopkins\n* MIT (ea)\n* UChicago (ED)\n* UMich (ea)\n* UPenn\n* UVA (ea)\n* VTech (ea)\n* William & Mary\n* Yale\n\n***Accepted***  \nCMU cs  \nCornell (Rawlings presidential scholars program)  \nDuke  \nEmory (accepted off waitlist)  \nGeorgetown  \nUMich (defer-->accepted)  \nUVA (Echols scholars program)  \nVTech (full ride scholarship)  \nWilliam & Mary (likely letter)  \nYale\n\n***Waitlisted***  \nBrown  \nEmory (accepted)  \nHarvard  \nUPenn\n\n***Rejected***  \nGTech  \nHopkins  \nMIT (after deferral)  \nUChicago (not even a deferral.

I don't even know man. This shit fun as hell tho\n2. Programming Club Co-President - Bro tbh our club is just a college apps farm but this is here ig.

Both were super cool cause I made some epic friends but yeah it was very chill.\n4. Competitive Math - Math community at my school is super fun :\\]. It was only like 1-2 hrs a week because I do programming instead but yeah.\n5. Testing / Problemsetting for CodeForces - Kinda fumbled this cause I don't think I conveyed what this is well, but separate to friends and stuff I have tested / problemset for the biggest online platform for competitive programming (a contest I did w/ a friend had like 30K participants lol)\n6. Paid Work - I worked at a Ramen / Sushi shop the Spring of 11th\n7. Walking my Dog - Ngl I was probably trolling at this point\n8. Musical Theatre - I did the musical this year. So fun. Wish I did it for all 4 but alas :((((\n9. Music Composition - For fun, barely even an EC but my friend and I would compose music together in 11th grade. We technically have an EP but it's really just yet another thing we've done together that is unfinished XDDD\n10. SciOly - Also only 12th grade. I did Entomology this year.

He babbled about like crafting a story and asked me questions to frame it as such but yeah he was nice. Hour or so long. (5/10)\n\nPrinceton: Very nice guy. We talked for 30 minutes about dumb stuff like Entomology, HG Wells, and math classes. Lowkey I forgot he said he was an Engi dude and asked him about his Senior thesis but hahahaha it's chill. (6/10)\n\n**Essays**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\n\nI have been inspired by my good buddy ezraft to post essays here. You don't wanna read them, they are not that good.\n\nI would rate them overall a 4/10, since I talked too much about CS. In retrospect there are certainly things I could've written to seem more unique and appealing, but it really wouldn't be wrong to say competitive programming has been one of the most defining parts of my high school career. Another bad thing was stacking common app which was already about Cp onto some supps where I wrote about the other side (organizing), but hey man who knows. I certainly don't, I'm not an AO. Lastly, my writing is not that good lmao.  \n[https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/mmr7496t3v189pczfd3e0/AERNJbX4AFyYVJThhtwG8FI?rlkey=75r4x9qqbdkycu8x68shzcgos&st=0phqc918&dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/mmr7496t3v189pczfd3e0/AERNJbX4AFyYVJThhtwG8FI?rlkey=75r4x9qqbdkycu8x68shzcgos&st=0phqc918&dl=0)\n\nI will briefly talk about them below. My UT Turing essay is missing but it was relatively mid I think I wrote about something similar to my JHU supp.\n\nPersonal Statement: I'm not sure. I wanted to write about my babysitter cause lowkey she's the goat and I am very grateful for her dealing with me from K-2nd grade as I learned to become a functional human being. Also I'm still a huge Pokemon fan so I kinda wanted to write about that. Also the former programming club president has been super influential on me and we're still chill to this day. Idk really. 5/10\n\nCMU: Talked too much about programming lol. Tried to fit in some music comp stuff but it doesn't read that well. 3/10\n\nCornell: Talked too much about programming lol. I did have fun at their contest though (I had to lie and say they wrote the goat problems but lets be fr...) 4/10\n\nDuke: I don't even know where my other optional supps went. I know I copied them off of other schools though. 2/10\n\nGeorgia Tech: I talked about mushrooms cause I was in a mushroom sort of mood. 3/10\n\nJHU: One of the later ones I wrote, so I tried to make a better story out of it. It's not very elegant though. 4/10\n\nMIT: I don't like my \"different path\" essay at all. Definitely one for the rubbish bin. I think my other ones are okay though, and I had to fit Pokemon somewhere again because they obviously don't see my personal statement. 4/10\n\nPrinceton: The first essay is pretty horrid but for all ivies I wanted to apply for more than just CS so here we are. I think my second one is the best essay I wrote all season, but that isn't saying much. I think I like it because the friends I've made at my school are TRULY some of the best amazingest people I've met and they're gonna do so many epic pog things in the future but also I'm so sad I only have a month left with them... I also wrote about helping organize and teach at a local programming event and meeting like 6th-8th grades who wanted to do programming, which was super dope. I think I used that idea for most ivies tho. I inted the short responses tho LOL don't even ask what I was thinking 6/10\n\nRice: I yoinked the princeton one lol. Also like a lot of other schools I talked about ICPC because I am SO ready to try out for ICPC and not make the team but still have fun doing competitive programming in uni LFGGGGG (5/10)\n\nUMD: UMD has the best supps and I memed on all of them tbh. (5/10)\n\nUNC: One of the first I wrote cause of the early deadline, pretty mid though. (3/10)\n\nUSC: I wrote about a board game cause I saw a USC viterbi article about the board game. Anyway W school for the fun supps. (4/10)\n\nUT: First supps I wrote, I talked about a work experience at the ramen restaurant but I never got to reuse it so it never ended up being polished in a future supp. The other supp I used quite frequently cause I think it's a funny story, my Dad thinks it's funny too. (3/10)\n\nYale: Close to the Edge is simply the best album ever. Tbh I should have wrote an essay about it but lowkey what is there to say aside from \"bro this shit so magical\" XD XD 5/10\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* University of Maryland + Gemstones Honors Program for Computer Science (EA)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (EA, declined the waitlist position)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Case Western Reserve University (Deferred EA, withdrawn)\n* University of Southern California (Deferred EA, withdrawn)\n* Georgia Institute of Technology (EA)\n* University of Texas at Austin (Deferred EA)\n* University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (RD)\n* Carnegie Mellon University (RD)\n* Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Deferred EA)\n* Johns Hopkins University (RD)\n* Rice University (RD)\n* Cornell University (RD)\n* Princeton University (RD)\n* Yale University (RD)\n* Duke University (RD)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nAnyway. Now for me to yap.\n\nFirst off.\n\nDONT BE LIKE ME APPLY TO SAFETIES OMFGGGGGG\n\nSecondly\n\nDo I have any regrets, aside from that? Not really. I am SUPER happy with my results and also, I had a blast in high school. I met so many cool people, did a lot of competitive programming, and fooled around online a lot. However, I clearly overestimated how strong my app was. And, well, that's okay. I've gotten amazing results anyways.\n\nAnyway, after looking at past results and discussing with some other oly grinders, it's clear that different schools have different preferences when it comes to olympiads. One of my friend with an international gold medal had a Cornell Wl as their best ivy result (they still got into MIT, dw), and another international gold medal got rejected from UIUC. Of my finalist / plat friends only one got into georgia tech, and so on. In such a case I would say my results are quite lucky and I am super grateful (more on that later).\n\nDo I recommend people do olympiads? Well, I'm clearly biased, but yeah. It is merely a matter of how much enjoyment you derive from them. I suspect most people will enjoy them quite a lot, and as such I recommend it. They are easier to get into than other extracurriculars, as all you really need to do is google the competition name and start solving practice problems, whether its Math, Physics, Coding, or whatever else.\n\nThe community, while a little weird and toxic, is fun when you inevitably find some close friends. The online contest I helped organize had people from CA bay area (duh), WA, NY, etc. Back then, I was USACO silver. In fact, for pretty much 2 years I was stuck at USACO Silver with no discernible progress. However, I kept solving problems genuinely cause it was just fun. It paid off, and the year I became got out of Silver I also became a Finalist. It was surreal meeting faces I had only known online for a year and laughing with them about stupid stuff or discussing programming problems. Much love to them all.\n\nI met my besties for the resties at the Cornell programming contest where I proceeded to solve 0 problems, and met someone who randomly DMed me on CodeForces asking to team at UPenn (he then punched me in the face accidentally after celebrating our full solve of the contest). Turns out he was the cousin of my friend I met in English LOL. Crazy. And at Thomas Jefferson, another friend and I had the most anime shit ever where he helped reduce a tough problem into something I knew how to solve, and neither of us understood how the other's part worked but we solved the problem so trust. What I'm trying to say is, olympiads are FAR MORE than just grinding every day. There is a lot of that, but there are also friends, fun, and other fuzzy warm feelings in your heart.\n\nNot everyone has put as much time into CF as I have, but I reckon they would not regret their experiences either. Friends don't give a shit about your rank. I helped out with the online contest while being silver alongside finalists (I also proposed an unsolvable problem that had to be scrapped lmao but shhh). Thus, your rank also doesn't matter for college apps. So, if the idea of olympiads appeals to you, try it out :\\]. Don't worry about opportunity cost or whatever.\n\nAs a final note, perhaps it is weird saying I got super lucky with just an acceptance to UMD. I would've been more than happy to attend (TERPS ON TOP), but funnily enough I got an email in February saying I got Accepted by the UT Turing Scholars program even though the school rejected me. I joined the waitlist and the day after Ivy Day I got accepted (WHILE AT AUSTIN LMAO). The costs have come out alright (30k more than UMD over 4 yrs) and I am a committed longhorn!!!!\n\nBut to be honest, when I thought I was attending UMD I lowkey realized my college list was stupid. Most reaches I wouldn't even attend over UMD and applied purely out of vibes and prestige since I am lucky enough to be in-state for a goated CS program. If I could redo my list, I would apply to different reaches (like I don't remember why I applied to Cornell, Rice, or JHU, for example), and definitely more targets/safeties like Penn State, UMN Twin Cities, or UMBC. Ignoring Cost, which UMD absolutely mogs  every reach in since I'm in state, it seems I would meet more people who are as into olympiads as me at UMD than other reaches (aside from MIT, ofc). I know of a finalist attending UMD this year, and I have a friend with USACO Plat + USAMO there too (supposedly even a mopper). As such, now I would not be able to justify to myself applying/attending if i got in to certain reaches if I got in. I am beyond grateful that my two acceptances were UMD and UT, and not some other schools XD.\n\nGood luck to the '26ers!\n\n  \nedit: my bad for the big blurb of text, some commenter said it wasn't clear so Yes, I am attending UT :DDD", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1k01rw7/lucky_results_for_olympiad_grinder_thoughts_about/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1k01rw7/lucky_results_for_olympiad_grinder_thoughts_about/", "upvotes": 75, "num_comments": 48, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "2024 results"}

I started competition math in 9th grade and never did a piano competition. I'd say I'm a more qualified musician than a mathematician, but I didn't have any of the tools or connections to do anything with all of the time I put into my composing/playing when it actually mattered. I spent a great deal of time on piano throughout high school and had nothing to show for it.\n\nI also would've put more time into summer programs. I didn't apply to any summer math programs since I preferred to work with kids and teach them math, but that's hard to quantify on an application. If I could do this all over again, I would've done one of two things: either fully apply as a social studies major for education (I noticed the humanities kids from my school did really well, STEM didn't), or just axe all of the education stuff and go for pure pure pure math. \n\nI got into some great schools and I'm quite proud of my results overall. I'm a little bummed out but really happy I got Penn, but I really think I got in because I go to a feeder school and not due to my actual merit. I think I could've gotten into all of my acceptances without a 13 AIME or other qualifications (maybe not Mudd) which is messing with me, since I was so proud of my score this year & it hasn't come through.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jrhwzo/usamo_harvard_legacy_gets_shot_in_the_head_by/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jrhwzo/usamo_harvard_legacy_gets_shot_in_the_head_by/", "upvotes": 53, "num_comments": 71, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "2024 results"}

AP Lang Teacher (9/10): she's known for writing great LORs, and only for those she really loves. i got along with her so well, and always did great, and also talked to her a lot like my therapist after-school. she was going to limit how many students she wrote for this year, and told me \"don't even worry, I'll write you one no matter what\" which was a rlly good sign IMO :) ... I LOVE HER!\n2. AP Computer Science Teacher (7.5/10): I'm not sure how good he writes, I didn't see the letter (don't really want to). I got along with him very well, and always talked to him more than other people did, but didn't see him much outside of class. I also had an attendance problem in his class. Nonetheless, I did a bunch of random challenge projects that took hours for fun and I think he really appreciated it (was on my brag sheet). Love him though\n3. AP Calc AB Teacher (8/10): Only submitted for Caltech as I needed a math letter. Still, he was very adamant and said it would be an honor to write for me. Also had an attendance problem in his class, but always was top of the class on the tests (which he would publicly broadcast). Didn't talk to him much, but did talk to him the most out of his class. Also, he went to BOTH HARVARD AND STANFORD?! Anyways, love the guy\n4. Counselor Recommendation (8.5/10): Only sung me praises. One of the only letters I actually saw. I talk to her all the time (in comparison to her other students, considering she has 350+) and give her hugs/appreciate her as much as possible. Talked about my background, family struggles, and how she's the first kid she's seen take on the courseload I have without any struggle. <3\n5. Board Vice President Recommendation (9/10): Was an optional recommendation, BUT I LOVE HER SO MUCH SHE'S MY SECOND MOM. She only wrote great things, talked about my time on the board, and how much of an influence I would be on campus. Sent to all schools that accepted it.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n* Yale — went very well, got along great, was with current Senior, went overtime (9/10)\n* MIT — went good, we got along good but nothing crazy, went slightly overtime (8/10)\n* Harvard — pretty good, he sent me some information post-interview, but I did accidentally bring up controversial topics, went slightly over time (7.5/10)\n* Princeton — AWESOME, got along with her great, bonded over a ton of common things in our lives, went very overtime (9.5/10)\n* Stanford — went superbly, we got along and were talking overtime and had a lot in common (9/10)\n\n**Essays**\n\n* Main Essay (8.5/10): Was pretty good, and had a college counselor (matchlighters program) help me (who I love). She kept saying that it was great and the best of her students, but I just thought it was good, nothing crazy. Mainly talked about how I took caring for my family and used it to fuel my passion for politics + law as a force for good after coming from generational oppression at the hands of politics. Took the most time, wasn't rushed.\n* Supplementals: Was mostly on my own. Wrote Harvard, MIT, Duke, and Caltech all in 30-1hr (each). Submitted Duke a couple of weeks late. Stanford, MIT and Princeton were reviewed by a counselor though, and she LOVED my Princeton one.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* **MIT (QuestBridge NCM / EA)**\n* **Harvard (CommonApp RD)**\n* **Stanford (QB RD; likely letter/early notification 2/6)**\n* **Yale (QB RD; likely letter 2/7)**\n* **Duke (QB RD; no interview)**\n* **Johns Hopkins (QB RD)**\n* **Swarthmore (QB RD)**\n* **Bowdoin (QB RD;** **faculty scholar award)**\n* **Middlebury (QB RD)**\n* **University of Washington, Seattle (CommonApp RD; direct admit to CS/Allen)**\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* **Caltech (QB RD)**\n* **Princeton (QB RD)**\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*note:* harvard was very unexpected -- my common app was much worse than my QB application, and.I wrote harvard's on a whim in 30mins. Princeton really surprised me, since my counselor kept saying that my application was the best for it (and a lot of the other schools accepted me with the same supplemental i originally wrote for Princeton). Something to note is that if I apply through QB, they see that I was admitted to MIT explicitly (since only MIT matches can keep using QB RD) so that might bias results.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jp9avl/the_chronic_skipper_stumbles_into_harvard_mit/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jp9avl/the_chronic_skipper_stumbles_into_harvard_mit/", "upvotes": 35, "num_comments": 18, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|Other", "query_matched": "2024 results"}

Initially, I expected to get into my local CSUs only, but the results turned out differently. I applied to 15 colleges, including 7 private schools.\n\n**Background Info:**\n\nI’m the oldest sibling in my family, a first-generation college applicant from California, from a low-income household, Hispanic, and male. Thanks to QuestBridge, I was able to apply to their partner private colleges for free after not getting matched to a college.\n\n**Academics**:\n\n* GPA: 4.13 Weighted and 3.97 Unweighted\n* AP Courses Taken: AP European History, APUSH, and AP Lang (Score: 3 for each AP exam)\n* AP's Currently Taking: AP Biology, AP Lit, and AP Gov\n* My Class Rank: 14/160 (Top 10%!)\n* SAT: Went test-optional for all colleges, but got a 1220 on my SAT\n   * Math: 570\n   * Reading: 650\n   * (Only had a month to study, so didn’t do the best I could’ve and only took it once)\n\n**Extracurriculars**:\n\n* **Varsity Girls Soccer Team Manager**:\n   * Prepared the field by setting up nets and floodlights, and organized paperwork with referees.\n   * Date Range: November 14th, 2023 – February 11th, 2025\n   * Hours: Over 160 community service hours.\n* **Babysitting Siblings**:\n   * Regularly cooked meals, helped with homework, and provided supervision and emotional support.\n   * Date Range: 2019 – Present\n   * Hours: Ongoing support to assist my mother while she works full-time.\n* **Youth Mental Health Academy - Child Mind Institute**:\n   * 14-month internship targeted California students from marginalized communities, offering a $2,000 stipend, hands-on mental health training, and mentoring.\n   * Date Range: June 24th, 2024 - August 3rd, 2025\n\n**Awards**:\n\n* Youth Mental Health Academy Capstone Community Impact Award 2024: Recognized for an exceptional presentation on mental health awareness in minorities.\n* AP Scholar Award: Achieved top scores on multiple AP exams.\n* 2024 National College Match Finalist: Selected as a finalist for a prestigious scholarship based on academic excellence and potential.\n* Honor Roll: Consistently maintained high academic performance every year.\n* Varsity Soccer Manager Certification: Earned through dedicated community service as the manager of the girls' varsity soccer team.\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\n* SDSU *(Early)*\n* CSU San Francisco\n* CSU Fullerton\n* CSU Long Beach\n* UCSD *(Full Ride!)*\n* UC Irvine *(Scholarship and Honors Program)*\n* UCLA\n* UC Berkeley\n* USC *(EA)*\n* Swarthmore *(Full Ride!)*\n\n**Waitlist:**\n\n* Haverford *(lol)*\n\n**Rejections:**\n\n* Stanford\n* Columbia\n* UPenn\n* Yale\n\n**Extra Stuff**:\n\n* Didn't receive a scholarship from USC EA and got rejected by the Gates Scholarship.\n* I have a 3.97 unweighted GPA since I got a singular B in ENS (P.E.) since I had so many absences and he would put it down as a grade. I had an 89 and I begged him to give me one point (he never did). I was so close to that 4.0, but oh well.\n* If you're wondering why I don't have many extracurriculars, it's because I wasn't made aware of the importance of participating in activities outside of school. After school, I would spend all my time playing games and taking care of my siblings. I wish I had been encouraged to join programs or activities after school earlier in life.\n* Had a personal PIQ coach from my school that helped me edit and make my PIQ's as perfect as they can be before I submitted them.\n* Last summer I attended the Berkeley Summer Experience, it was pretty fun ngl. I also got in for Discover Swarthmore and went during October, literally LOVE that liberal arts college. I didn't get into WOW, the Yale Flight-in, or Explore Bowdoin.\n\n**Conclusion**: So yeah, those are my stats. I'm very grateful that I got in my top 3 dream colleges (Swarthmore, USC, and UCLA). I'm still deciding between USC or Swarthmore, we'll see. But yeah, thank you guys for reading and I hope you guys are happy with your decisions!\n\n*(If you have any questions, I would be happy to answer down below or message me, I'm kinda new to this lol)*", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jopw6z/college_decisions_with_3_extracurriculars_for/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jopw6z/college_decisions_with_3_extracurriculars_for/", "upvotes": 13, "num_comments": 18, "flair": "3.8+|1200+/25+|SocSci", "query_matched": "2024 results"}

Talked about instrumental ECs and my favorite fields of interest in physics.\n\n**Essays**\n\nI thought my essays for my EA schools were horrible but they still got me accepted so idk. Loved my RD essays but they didn't get me any acceptances--idk. My parents DID pay for one of those professional essay reviewing people—they helped me write my personal statement, Caltech, and UC essays. My personal statement was good (wrote about watching my pet birds) and I guess it offered a unique perspective (more unique than I could've came up with). I think it helped me get accepted but also WL from T20s instead of straight up rejected.

My school doesn't have a lot of resources and student interests in academics so I can't really start a club that much. I got accepted into an internship this summer but had to reject it because of my work at the restaurant and transportation issues. Overall there's not a lot of opportunities at my school and my circumstances also limited the few opportunities I had like sports. I hope my application would be evaluated based on my context and that AOs would see that I really tried to take advantage of anything I could as long as it didn't tax my family's financial situation.🤒🤕\n\nBtw I’m also confident about my app becuz of my school lol. There was one Harvard applicant this year and they got waitlisted. They showed me their app and tbh it wasn’t that good. They didn’t know how to order their activities from most important to least and instead did it in a random order 💀. They also had quite a bit of B’s.

Please take everything I say here with healthy skepticism! These are just a 17 year old's opinions!\n\nIf you are doom scrolling this subreddit trying to ascertain your chances of getting into certain colleges, LOG OFF RIGHT NOW AND JUST WRITE THE APPLICATION. Several months ago, I was doing the same and almost removed CMU from my list. First of all, you cannot accurately ascertain what correlates to acceptances into which colleges because there are SO MANY CONFOUNDING VARIABLES and also a great deal of sheer randomness. Secondly, after you have your common app stuff done, most applications takes like max 10 hours. If you have the time, just apply everywhere you want to, and if they reject you, that's like max 10 hours wasted :D.\n\nI don't want to push my opinions on to you, but I think \"applying sideways\" is a really good idea, not necessarily because it will improve your results, but because it will allow to grow into an actual adult who knows what they want before college, which I think is pretty useful.\n\nCollege counselors are, in my opinion, generally pretty useless. I didn't make use of counseling services, but my brother and friends did and the all the advice their counselors gave seemed pretty bullshitty to me (for example, \"show more family values\" or \"you should showcase your entrepreneurial side in this essay\"). They can say whatever they want and chances are you'll believe them, and they will generally be able to show that they give students better-than-median college results because, in general, only the wealthy can afford them, and the wealthy have myriad other advantages in college applications.\n\nWhich college you go to doesn't determine your worth as a person (obviously)! I am still a hot mess (at least I'm hot though)!!!!!!\n\nI had little confidence going into this process, and it really doesn't matter whether I was right or wrong to have low confidence because it was still unproductive. Have some healthy conceit, kings, queens, and everything in betweens!\n\nControversial, but can we please collectively kill the jarring present tense \"hook\" that doesn't match the tone of the rest of the essay? Please and thank you /hj.\n\nI don't know you, but if it means anything, I believe in you :D. Not for college admissions specifically, just in general, I believe in you!\n\nFeel free to reach out to me! Also, if you know me, please don't dox :3", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1i3r76m/bay_area_baddie_bags_cmu_cs/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1i3r76m/bay_area_baddie_bags_cmu_cs/", "upvotes": 67, "num_comments": 34, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "2024 results"}

AP Lang Teacher (9/10): she's known for writing great LORs, and only for those she really loves. i got along with her so well, and always did great, and also talked to her a lot like my therapist after-school. she was going to limit how many students she wrote for this year, and told me \"don't even worry, I'll write you one no matter what\" which was a rlly good sign IMO :) ... I LOVE HER!\n2. AP Computer Science Teacher (7.5/10): I'm not sure how good he writes, I didn't see the letter (don't really want to). I got along with him very well, and always talked to him more than other people did, but didn't see him much outside of class. I also had an attendance problem in his class. Nonetheless, I did a bunch of random challenge projects that took hours for fun and I think he really appreciated it (was on my brag sheet). Love him though\n3. AP Calc AB Teacher (8/10): Only submitted for Caltech as I needed a math letter. Still, he was very adamant and said it would be an honor to write for me. Also had an attendance problem in his class, but always was top of the class on the tests (which he would publicly broadcast). Didn't talk to him much, but did talk to him the most out of his class. Also, he went to BOTH HARVARD AND STANFORD?! Anyways, love the guy\n4. Counselor Recommendation (8.5/10): Only sung me praises. One of the only letters I actually saw. I talk to her all the time (in comparison to her other students, considering she has 350+) and give her hugs/appreciate her as much as possible. Talked about my background, family struggles, and how she's the first kid she's seen take on the courseload I have without any struggle. <3\n5. Board Vice President Recommendation (9/10): Was an optional recommendation, BUT I LOVE HER SO MUCH SHE'S MY SECOND MOM. She only wrote great things, talked about my time on the board, and how much of an influence I would be on campus. Sent to all schools that accepted it.\n\n\n\n**Interviews**\n\n* Yale\n   * Yale apparently was rare to get for Questbridge NCM applicants, only 20% or so of applicants got one. I loved my interviewer, she was a current senior and we talked forever about music and just random stuff. She said she wanted me to go to Yale just so we could meet on campus (then we realized that wouldn't work cause she'd be gone lol)\n* MIT\n   * Everyone got an MIT interview (essentially). I got along well, but not crazy well, with my interviewer. Still, we talked for 30mins+ over the allotted time, and he kept saying how he was learning new things from me.\n\n\n\n**Essays**\n\n* Main Essay (8.5/10): Was pretty good, and had a college counselor (matchlighters program) help me (who I love). She kept saying that it was great and the best of her students, but I just thought it was good, nothing crazy. Mainly talked about how I took caring for my family and used it to fuel my passion for politics + law as a force for good after coming from generational oppression at the hands of politics. Took the most time, wasn't rushed.\n* Supplementals: Didn't have her review as much of my supplemental. The MIT supplemental was only 100-words, I at most spent 20mins on it. They were all over the place (depending on if she reviewed them). \n\n\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* **MIT (QuestBridge NCM / EA)**\n\n*W*ill/*Have Applied (will update once I get RD results):*\n\n* Harvard\n* Yale\n* Stanford\n* Princeton\n* Caltech\n* Duke\n* Swarthmore\n* Bowdoin\n* Middlebury\n* University of Washington (Seattle)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*note:* i am a questbridge applicant (through the national college match) so my application process is slightly different. essentially, questbridge is for FGLI students. the national college match is a process where you get to rank up to 15 schools, and the first school to accept you you 'match' with with a full ride. but, they don't tell you who else accepted you, and it's ED for all QB schools OTHER THAN **MIT**. if you match with MIT (like me) you still can do RD. **i have no clue whether I got into any other school than MIT because they don't tell me -- MIT was my top choice -- so I have to apply RD to see if I got into any others :)**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1he19de/constant_skipper_guy_w_30_absences_already_gets/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1he19de/constant_skipper_guy_w_30_absences_already_gets/", "upvotes": 83, "num_comments": 39, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|Other", "query_matched": "2024 results"}

All my MUN awards (2 Intn’l, 2 natn’l, 1 regional and 1 school, all through 4 years), mentioned a merit-based full ride I got for one of my country’s best engineering unis, and an intn’l award from Oxford Climate Change Challenge. \n2.

Some dotted descriptions of two independent engineering projects I made (technical stuff + objectives)\n5. My Linkedin link (I am somewhat active there)\n6. Clarified my Math level was Calc AB and that I worked on BC on Khan Academy for a bit.\n\n\n**Essays**: \n\n*Personal Statement*: 8.5/10. It took SUPER LONG but I actually loved it. Explored how I used writing and engineering to address the need to keep the memory of past Argentinian dictatorship kidnappings (which directly affected my family) and the Holocaust alive. \n\n*Supplementals*:\n- 9/10: Princeton, Brown and NYU\n- 8/10: Notre Dame, Lehigh and Williams\n- 7/10: Amherst, Dartmouth and W&L\n- 6/10: Harvard\n- 5/10: JHU, UPenn and Bowdoin (mentioned wrong school name 💀)\n- 4/10: Columbia and Stanford \n\nI didn’t start any more than one week before deadline. I think 90% were done on the day (and ~50% on the hour before 🙃)\n\n\n**Interviews**: TOO MANY \n\n- Bowdoin: 5.5/10 - My first and yapped too much \n- Stanford: 6/10 - Didn’t know a single thing about the school, but I was pretty happy with most of my answers. \n- Princeton: 9/10 - I feel I really shined through and vibed with my interviewer. \n- UPenn: 10/10 - Hands down the best conversation of my LIFE. Super interesting. \n- Yale: 7.5/10 - Senior interview, could’ve been better but I was in vacation lol\n- NYU: 8.5/10 - Short but super sweet. \n- Dartmouth: 8/10 - Started rough ended super good. \n- W&L Johnson Finalist: 7/10 - Weird questions but felt I navigated them somewhat nicely. \n\nAs you can see by comparing the results I got from schools that interviewed me and those that didn’t, I think most interviews really played in my favor 😄 being a debate kid really came in handy here. \n\n\n**Decisions** (REA/EA/ED/RD):\n\n**ACCEPTED** : \n\n- >!Washington and Lee + Johnson Scholar (full-ride merit scholarship + 10k merit stipend)!<\n- >!Bowdoin + Faculty Scholars (full-ride financial aid scholarship + 3k merit stipend)!<\n - >!NYU Abu Dhabi (tuition + room financial aid scholarship)!<\n\n\n**WAITLISTED**:\n\n- >!Princeton (later rejected)!<\n- >!Columbia (later rejected)!<\n- >!UPenn (later rejected)!<  \n- >!Brown (later rejected)!<  \n- >!Dartmouth (later rejected)!<\n- >!Williams (later rejected)!<\n\n\n**REJECTIONS**:\n\n- Stanford (rejected REA)\n- Harvard\n- Yale\n- Johns Hopkins\n- Amherst\n- Notre Dame\n- Lehigh\n- Case Western Reserve\n\n\n**PRE-DECISION REFLECTION** (only knowing about Stanford): I only applied to universities that would beat a full ride to my fav university in my country so pretty ambitious elections (no safeties or matches!). I decided to apply abroad pretty late for the standard I saw (April 2023), and involved an awful lot of familiarization with the process. If I don’t get anywhere still I DONT REGRET IT FOR A SECOND: I learnt more english, to manage legal documents and resumes, contact people all over the world,  enhanced writing skills, a lot of self discovery and reflection and controlling challenging deadlines. It also brought me a lot closer to God somehow, and I learnt to at least aim to put my worries in Jesus and trust that everything will go as it should. When I was rejected I thought about giving up applying anywhere else (not being even deferred hit somewhat hard), but pretty happy that I continued. Now we’ll have to see, but I deeply believe any decision will be for the better. \n\n**POST-DECISION REFLECTION**: I am honestly so surprised and happy with my decisions. I only now fully realized how difficult it is for full-aid seeking internationals to even secure one university. I know 30+ EXTREMELY TALENTED PEOPLE (perfect GPA, valedictorians, 1450+ SAT, amazing ECs) from my country applying for full-rides in the U.S. and I think only 3 got one. So I’m super grateful for the three opportunities and the waitlists. I’m having a hard time choosing where to go, but honestly super blessed I even get to choose. And I also now I see how important it is to shotgun to 15+ places for aid seeking internationals. \n\nI chose Washington and Lee, go generals 💙", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1d1duiw/fullaid_south_american_in_stem_gets_very/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1d1duiw/fullaid_south_american_in_stem_gets_very/", "upvotes": 39, "num_comments": 31, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "2024 results"}

Worked primarily under State Senator in order to advocate for Dem. majority + governor, ballot questions, etc. Extensive grassroots canvassing. Union partnerships. Focused on advocating for passage of question regarding change in taxes in order to fund public schools' free lunches post-COVID. \n2. Campaign Manager Intern – 2024 State Senator Campaign (12th)\n   1. Re-hired again by State Senator to run signature-gathering campaign for 400+ in order to re-run. Democratic caucuses representative for Sen. Volunteer mobilization. Student recruitment.

Heavy focus on preservation of accessible transportation, environmentally friendly parks, zoning laws. \n4. Interviewer/Coordinator – Oral History Project (10th-11th)\n   1. Conducted project on important historical event in my cultural background by interviewing people about their experiences w/ the aim to preserve history in face of government censorship under Teacher Recc #1. \n5.

Typical things, again, but this time consistently placed top 3 in state comp. every year! \n7. Opinion Editor – School Newspaper (9th-12th)\n   1. Typical things! Geared my section to write about more political and current event topics, however. \n8. Independent Writer (9th-12th)\n   1. 70K+ words in total of various short stories, poems, and movie scripts. Lots published in local newspapers, school literature magazines, etc. \n9. JV: Co-Captain, V: 1B – JV & Varsity Softball (9th-12th)\n   1. Self-explanatory!\n10.

Medal from State's National History Day Comp (10th)\n2. Various medals, awards, and honors from National Latin Exam (10th-12th)\n3. Various school awards about writing & social studies (11th). \n\n  \n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n(My guidance counselor read both of my recommendation letters and said that they were some of the best he's ever seen. Not sure how reliable this opinion is!)\n\n1. **HISTORY/ECON TEACHER** (9/10) – Extremely close to him from the start of 10th grade. He supervised + advised my oral history project during my time TAing for him. Said that my recc letter was the best & easiest he's ever written in his decades of teaching. \n2. **ENGLISH TEACHER** (8/10) – Also close to him, but not as close to him as #1. 11th and 12th; got to see a lot of my writing skills (creative, argumentative, analytical), as well as my public speaking skills. \n3. **STATE SENATOR** (6/10) – Worked with him a bunch for internships. He's pretty involved in Harvard's community and is a Harvard alum. Not sure if this had an impact at all, tbh. \n\n  \n**Interviews**\n\n1. **Brandeis** (Optional) – 7/10\n   1. 15 minute in-person interview with a Brandeis admission employee who was a year older than me! Talked about my passion about political science and campaigning with her, who was also interested in polisci. 15 minute interview doesn't really do much though, but maybe it did get me the fat package I got? \n2. **Tufts** (Optional) – 9/10\n   1. 30 minute Zoom interview turned into 1.5 hours. Didn't realize my interviewer was literally a part of Tufts' Office of Trustees until after! We talked about Tufts only briefly because I knew a lot from hanging around Tufts campus while my dad was working + participating in Tufts' faculty community events. The other one hour was us talking about our town's politics, my school's culture (she had a younger child in private school and was curious about my town's public school), my campaign experience, which I thought went really well! \n      1. PS– she ended up congratulating me on my acceptance 30 minutes after my acceptance result came out and asked if we could go get coffee together + offered a personal campus tour!\n3. **Georgetown** – 3/10\n   1. This was horrible. My very first interview and my interviewer made it very uncomfortable for me to talk about my struggles as a POC and political advocacy, so my interview felt very bland and one-sided. (She was very much legacy, white, and wealthy). She also kept emphasizing how she had multiple of these and how she was on a very strict time limit, which made me feel as if she were rushing me and that I was a waste of her time. I'm 99% sure she had crammed all of her interviews on that Saturday, so.\n4. **Princeton** – 5/10\n   1. Not horrible, not great. My interviewer and I met in a local cafe and she talked about herself more than there was room to talk about me. Overall, I left feeling like I could've said more about myself, but there was also no time/space to do so.\n5. **Harvard** – 7/10\n   1. My best interview. My interviewer very much made the interview feel like a conversation and she was genuinely interested in the political work I had done despite us having completely different interests (her, a STEM major, me, humanities). By the end, I felt like I had given it my best shot and she seemed relatively pleased. \n\n**Essays**  \nNot great, not bad. Nothing outstanding, I would say, but definitely above average. My CommonApp and my supplements reflected my passions for politics as well as my background and passions as a regular human.   \n**Decisions**  \nAcceptances:\n\n* UMass Amherst (in-state) – EA\n* University of Vermont ($84K + Honors) – EA\n* Brandeis (Humanities Fellow Scholarship: $96K, Intl Business Scholars Program) – RD\n* Tufts – RD -> COMMITTED \n   * I get free tuition, so this was a no brainer out of all of my decisions! + excellent IR program and close to home. \n* Northeastern NUin ($36K) – EA\n* Wesleyan – RD\n\nGuaranteed Transfer:\n\n*  Boston University – RD \n\nWaitlists:\n\n* Colby – RD\n* Middlebury – RD\n* NYU – RD\n* Williams – RD\n* Harvard – RD\n\nRejections:\n\n* Columbia – ED\n* Brown – RD\n* Yale – RD\n* Princeton – RD\n* Georgetown – RD\n\n**Comments**: \n\nYou're probably wondering why I didn't ED to Tufts knowing that they have an incredible IR program and get free tuition and are close to home. I don't know. My parents wanted me to give a shot at other schools and they were willing to pay more money if I had gotten into a better school, but we agreed that otherwise I would be going to Tufts. I feel really fortunate and lucky for being in the position that I'm in, and although this process was literal hell it all worked out!

He has seen the best of me (in terms of the work I produce and in terms of teamwork/personality/etc). (10/10)\n\n**#2**: 11th Grade English Teacher: Unfortunately some of the schools I applied to needed a STEM and non-STEM letter. I could not ask any of my history teachers (one left and the other is the head of speech and debate and got too many requests for me to ask them). In 11th grade I took two 1 semester English classes (and asked one of those teachers). I did good work and participated in discussions, but I only had the teacher for 1 semester. (\\~6/10).\n\n**Interviews**\n\n**MIT**: A disaster. The interview seemed very focused on my achievements and when I tried to talk about our robotics team’s trip to France and how we were able to preserve and how much we learned, her comment was: so you didn’t win?\n\n**Harvey Mudd**: I think it went okay. He seemed to understand how much my activities meant to me and why I did them, but I feel like it did not really add much to my application.\n\n**UPenn**: Of the 3, it felt the best. I got along great with my interviewer and it felt a lot more like a 2 way conversation than a Q&A session. He seemed genuinely interested in all of my activities and I got a lot more time and freedom to talk about the importance of my non-STEM activities (ex: hiking, TOPSoccer, etc).\n\n**Essays**\n\nI am not a great writer, but I felt like my essays were the best pieces of writing I have produced. I felt like each essay really represented me as a person and showed what mattered to me and why. My common app essay was about our robotics team’s struggles in France and how our expectations and goal of winning was not the most important takeaway from the competition (we got last). Instead it was about learning and the bond of teamwork that comes with working shoulder to shoulder overnight in a hotel lobby trying to fix our robot and how 24 hours after the competition I immediately took what I learned and applied it at COSMOS and the success that resulted from that. My supplementals for most places were usually pretty good except for the diversity essay. For those, I generally turned it on how diverse skill sets are crucial to success using the example of the NYU summer program and our group’s success. For the why major questions I tried to show how I enjoy CS because it enables me to help other people (ex: book exchange, TA, etc). I also had a good topic of my Linear Algebra and the Math behind AI independent study, where even though my school wasn’t going to give me credit, that wasn’t why I was doing it. (Instead it was about learning and enjoying working closely with other students where we each had different focused/desired takeaways but were able to tackle a bigger subject.)\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n**Acceptances**:\n\nSanta Clara University (EA)\n\nPurdue University (EA -> deferred -> accepted)\n\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder (EA)\n\nUniversity of Oregon (EA/Rolling)\n\nUniversity of New Mexico (EA/Rolling)\n\nSan Diego State University (RD/Rolling)\n\nUniversity of California Santa Cruz (RD)\n\n**Waitlists**:\n\nUniversity of Michigan (EA -> deferred -> waitlisted)\n\nNortheastern University (EA -> deferred -> waitlisted)\n\nUniversity of California Davis (RD)\n\nUniversity of California Irvine (RD)\n\nCarnegie Mellon University (RD)\n\nBoston University (RD)\n\n**Rejections**:\n\nHarvest Mudd College (ED2)\n\nUniversity of California San Diego (RD)\n\nUniversity of Southern California (EA -> deferred -> rejected)\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology (EA -> deferred -> rejected)\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (EA -> deferred -> rejected)\n\nUniversity of Washington (EA)\n\nCal Poly San Luis Obispo (RD)\n\nUniversity of California Los Angeles (RD)\n\nUniversity of California Berkeley (RD)\n\nUniversity of California Santa Barbara (RD)\n\nColumbia University (RD)\n\nHarvard University (RD)\n\nYale University (RD)\n\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (RD)\n\nWashington University (St. Louis) (RD)\n\nNew York University (RD)\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania (RD)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nTo quickly expand on my school: generally very academically hard for most people\\* but not really “competitive.” People are very willing to work on homework together, cross compile notes, help each other prepare for tests, and many classes are designed with this in mind. In general, most people from my school go to smaller private/liberal arts colleges, but many go to Ivies/HYPSM (both for academics and we have a lot of sports commits, last year was a bit of an outlier but we had \\~14 go for academics). (\\*The first thing most of my friends would say about my school is that it is hard and they get no sleep, but I mostly had a different experience. I was able to keep similar/better grades and activities/sports while going to bed at 10PM and not doing any work past 8/9PM.)\n\nTo expand on the rankings: I know I am at least in the top 20% and from comparing grades with others, I am at the top of the group behind the people who have a 4.0 UW.\n\n**Reflection**\n\nI knew from the start that my college results would not define the rest of my life and where I applied/wanted to go would not be based on name/prestige/ranking. I genuinely love school and I do the activities/etc that I do because I actually enjoy them (both are significantly different to a lot of my friends) and I know that wherever I go, I know I will do great. Also I knew that:\n\n* Comparison is the thief of joy: I would not compare my results to anyone else's or feel bad that the school I end up getting into is ranked X while someone else gets into a school ranked X - 1\n* I also would take each rejection in a personal way: If I was rejected, it was a sign that I would not be happy there. It would be likely some combination of the academics would be too hard or the fit was not good.\n\nHowever, despite knowing all this, I still feel generally unhappy with my results. By far, of the 30 places I applied to, UCSD and Harvey Mudd were my top 2 choices. While obviously I would have been very happy if I got into any of the reach schools I applied to (Ivies, UC Berkeley, CalTech, UW Georgia Tech, etc), I feel like I did not fully consider the fact that I would not end up at UCSD or Harvey Mudd. I liked my school college counselor (even if she was mostly an echo chamber instead of guiding advice), but I feel like she very heavily implied that I had very good chances at UCSD and Harvey Mudd and said my essays were the best she had ever read and was very surprised when I told her my results.\n\nAlso, in spite of what I said earlier, it is hard not feeling the pressures of not going to a very very very highly ranked/prestigious school. It doesn’t help that my friends are going to Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Cornell, UMich, Harvard, Yale, and Berkeley mostly for CS/STEM and my parents and 7 of their cousins went to Berkeley. I think these feelings are not necessarily: “X got into a higher rank than me,” but more on the lines of: “X is going somewhere they wanted to go” and there is that open question of if I did get in to one of those, would I be happier because at least the fact that it is very very very very highly ranked makes up for my lack of excitement. Again, contrary to what I said earlier, I did end up applying to almost all of the top ranked schools in the US. However, I think there is also the question of (at least from my parents) if I applied and happened to get lucky at some of the other top schools I didn’t apply to (Cornell, Dartmouth, etc)\\* as some of my friends got in despite getting into no UCs. (\\*Parents consoled against those 2 especially initially; Cornell: people are depressed there and the weather is bad and Dartmouth: “worst of the Ivies”.)\n\nI think my only 3 regrets of high school were:\n\n* Not skipping a math level when I had the option to;\n* Not spending more time looking into/visiting colleges before picking which ones I wanted to apply to (or maybe not \"shotgunning\" harder because I had more than enough time/energy to submit more applications that had good quality);\n* And not retaking the ACT. On practice tests, I had been getting close to perfect in all 4 sections but on the actual test I missed like 12 questions on the math section which was usually my strongest. (Also parents really wanted a 36 overall.)\n\nOverall, writing this has been mostly therapeutic and helped me (sort of) organize why I am still a little unhappy. I would like to finish by again saying: my parents are very supportive of whatever decision I make and not openly sad/disappointed/angry and I know that I will do great and I am not worried (just unhappy that I might end up where it snows…).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1buw1y1/indian_male_unhappy_because_he_didnt_get_into/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1buw1y1/indian_male_unhappy_because_he_didnt_get_into/", "upvotes": 28, "num_comments": 24, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "2024 results"}

The reason for this is that my parents put one word extracurriculars e.g. \"Squash,\" instead of explaining it in detail last year. This year, I put down my extracurriculars and mentioned some that my parents didn't mention last year, which I think led to me being rejected. For example, I said that I have been doing competition math for 3 years but last year my application didn't have competition math on it.\n\nI am not exactly surprised about the Exeter decision either, considering my essays. I am, however, a bit surprised about my Riverdale decision because it was easily my strongest application and the least competitive school. Ig different schools take different people, or im just bad.\n\nI'm completely fine with going to my current public school, however am a tiny bit regretful for not applying to more schools.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1bu7qae/20232024_admissions_cycle_privateboarding_high/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1bu7qae/20232024_admissions_cycle_privateboarding_high/", "upvotes": 10, "num_comments": 2, "flair": "3.8+|Other|Art/Hum", "query_matched": "2024 results"}

Before high school, I grew up in California, if that makes a difference. Plus this post is a year late which means I was part of the 2022-2023 application cycle, not the current 2023-2024 application cycle.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nAt the end of the day, I was the (below?) average Asian male CS applicant with a competitive academic record but a relatively unremarkable extracurricular profile, with nothing “new” to offer. While my application had its strengths, it lacked the compelling narrative or unique hook that top-tier institutions often seek. Nevertheless, my college applications strategy revolved around shotgunning a myriad of schools in hopes that my good fortune would get me into one good school; however, my hopes did not come to fruition, which is disappointing as it means I could stopped my applications during the early cycle with the exact same results and have avoided the costs of over a thousand dollars, dozens to hundreds of hours of invested time, and false hopes. I recognize that my in-state status likely played a significant role in my acceptance to UNC Chapel Hill, as I was rejected or waitlisted by many of my reach schools.\n\nLooking back, I regret not seizing opportunities to explore my passions and engage in more meaningful extracurricular pursuits. There are an innumerable number of these pursuits that I find out about on a daily basis to have regretfully missed. The COVID-19 pandemic undoubtedly disrupted many aspects of my high school experience, but I cannot help but feel that I used it as an excuse to coast. In addition to having my freshman year cut short by the pandemic and my sophomore year fully virtual, I was offered the option to remain virtual for my junior year, which I regretfully accepted. Until my mom attended a college applications webinar in the spring of my junior year, I was blissfully ignorant of everything happening around me, at which point it was too late to change.\n\nAs this post is a year late, I can tack on a short reflection of my first year at UNC Chapel Hill. I have innumerable gripes with the institution and its policies (if I start explaining those, they will go on forever); however, I am still grateful for effectively being granted a “second chance”. I fully recognize that in my situation, I could have suffered infinitely worse outcomes; I am fortunate enough to have a strong state school with enough opportunities and resources to not have limited my future options. I have met a number of great people over the past year and hope to make the most of the opportunities I have to secure a bright future for myself.\n\nP.S. if you’re reading this and you know who I am, I would appreciate it if you do not dox me :)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1bu5lbi/mediocre_asian_male_in_cs_gets_rightfully/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1bu5lbi/mediocre_asian_male_in_cs_gets_rightfully/", "upvotes": 37, "num_comments": 46, "flair": "3.8+|1200+/25+|STEM", "query_matched": "2024 results"}

Sat in front of class so I got to talk with her a lot directly and develop a good relationship\n3. **College Government Lecturer 8.5/10**: Also very good relationship and great interactions in and out of the classroom about discussion in government, my heritage, medicine.

Got to talk with him about my ecs, passions, and involvements for LORs and knew I was very motivated\n\n**Interviews**:\n\n**Denison** 10/10: LOVED MY INTERVIEWER SO MUCH. Helped me calm my nerves before I started b/c I lowkey forgot I signed up for one during my visit but we ended up having a conversation that lasted towards an hour. Got to talk about my passions and pride with heritage and went on tangents about coffee and the history of Ethiopia. Sent me a nice letter in the mail afterwards about it too.\n\n**Princeton** 8/10: my interviewer was a retired lawyer so even tho i had interests in stem, we went on tangents about public policy, personal experiences with politics and making/connecting with old friends. spoke for 45 min and it naturally felt like 2 friends having a convo. said i had great confidence and good answers! also gave me a lot of suggestions about what to do/explore if i do end up going.\n\n**Dartmouth:** 8.5/10: interview lasted about an hour and my interviewer was a psych prof at the uni i did research at and was class of 64 from dartmouth. he was surprisingly impressed by my resume and the amount of activities i did as he went through each one on the copy i gave him. talked a lot about my research and the program i started . also got to talk a lot about my heritage and growing up FGLI for part of the interview and he seemed very interested in. asked if ed'd there but hoped i would get in. suggested id be a really good fit given i was interested in environmental studies and looking for tight-knit community.\n\n**Cornell**: 6/10: nothing too special and significant. my interviewer was on call in his car and basically said that the interview was just supposed to be informational. just explained to me why i should come to cornell and asked if i have any questions about the campus/programs\n\n**Essays**:\n\n**Common App**: 9/10 I LOVE MY ESSAY SO MUCH and a lot of people liked it too. talked about niche hobby i had about crushing rocks when i was like 6. connected it to my passions for environmental sci. as well as a cool metaphor for getting closer with my culture.\n\n**Supps; 7-8/10**: Reused a lot since I applied to 28 schools.

Tried to be as creative as possible tho\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n***Acceptances***\\*\\*\\*:\\*\\*\\*\n\nState Schools- EA w/ 200k in total\n\nHoward- EA w/ 20k (still waiting on Karsh Scholars results..)\n\nPurdue- EA w/ honors+10k\n\nTuskegee- EA w/ full ride\n\nWingate- EA w/ 30K\n\nMiami Uni.- EA w/ honors+13k\n\nOSU\n\nPenn State\n\n***Rejections\\*:\\****\n\nCase Western PPSP\n\n***Awaiting***\n\nIvys except Columbia b/c of lack of space on common app\n\nStanford\n\nUMich\n\nCWRU (regular)\n\nJHU\n\nDenison\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional Info**:\n\n\\-I moved schools like twice, once because I moved neighborhoods after being virtual freshman year and twice because I enrolled in a career tech program for my major at another high school. Because of this program and moving schools after being virtual for COVID, I had credit transferring and scheduling issues which limited my # of APs I could take pretty much all 4 years. Overall, I wanted to still challenge myself over the years so my rigor increased with honors and DE classes while still maintaining my GPA. I also did this b/c I though I was gonna go to my state school anyway💀. I made sure to explain this in my add. info and had my counselor talk about it in LOR.\n\n\\-I mentioned in my add. info that I'm taking Coursera courses in Calc 1 and Gen chem in my free time since I could not fit them in my schedule. Don't know if that's helpful tho.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Final Notes:**\n\nOverall, I am aware I am not the best t20 applicant out there as many people on reddit have said that time and time again to me but it doesn't hurt to have some hope tbh, especially being first gen. Although I did basically shotgun, I am honestly very content with the schools I have gotten in rn with OSU being my top choice considering their top-notch public-health programs and research opportunities.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1ar65i7/first_gen_african_beggin_for_one_t20_acceptance/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1ar65i7/first_gen_african_beggin_for_one_t20_acceptance/", "upvotes": 38, "num_comments": 15, "flair": "3.8+|1300+/28+|STEM", "query_matched": "2024 results"}

(If you know who I am shhhhh)\n\n\\*More tips and personal opinions I have at the bottom of this post!\n\n**Demographics**\n\n* Gender: F\n* Race/Ethnicity: Asian\n* Residence: IL\n* Income Bracket: single parent makes around 70,000-90,000\n* Type of School: public high school\n* Hooks: One parent earned a Masters from WashU, not sure if that counts\n\n**Intended Major(s)**: Electrical & Computer Engineering\n\n**Academics**\n\n* GPA (UW/W): 3.9 UW, 4.6 W\n* Rank (or percentile): unranked, but I’d estimate top 20%?\n\nFreshman Year Course Load (only listed honors/AP):\n\n* AP Human Geo (4)\n* Hon English\n* Hon Alg II & Trig\n* Hon Bio\n* self-studied AP Chinese Exam (5)\n\nSophomore Year Course Load:\n\n* AP Computer Science Principles (5)\n* AP Music Theory (5: Non-Aural 5, Aural 4)\n* Hon English II\n* Hon Precalc\n* Hon Chem\n\nJunior Year Course Load:\n\n* AP US History (5)\n* AP Lang (5)\n* AP Calc BC (5)\n* AP Psych (5)\n* AP French (didn't take exam)\n\nSenior Year Course Load (didn't study for AP exams lol):\n\n* AP Physics C (Mech 4, E&M 2)\n* AP Macro (4)\n* AP Stats (5)\n* AP Computer Science A (4)\n* Multivariable Calc dual credit\n\n**Standardized Testing**\n\nSAT (reported both):\n\n* 1530 March 2022 (770RW, 760M)\n* 1550 April 2022 (760RW, 790M, 7-7-8 Writing)\n\nACT: 35 (35E, 34M, 36R, 35S)\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities** (I ordered these mostly based on the amount of time I spent on each activity)\n\n1. Sport (leaving this vague, but no scholarships are offered in the US for this sport unless at a national/Olympic level): captain for a year, 4 year varsity, state top 12\n2. Family responsibilities (in my circumstances, I felt like it was appropriate to list)\n3. Local business job: worked for 3 years, assist. manager\n4. Keyboard-building (like the only thing I have relevant to my intended major): just a personal hobby I spent time on, no competitions or anything professional lol\n5. English tutor: started in middle school, worked with both local and overseas students, helped improve grammar, fluency, SAT/ACT, essays, etc\n6. Mu Alpha Theta: 2 yrs\n7. French Honors Society: 1 yr\n8. Instrument (both solo and part of a studio): performed at places such as multicultural events and senior centers, started in middle school\n9. Volunteer cook at a charity: started in elementary school with my family\n10. Volunteer at my local animal shelter: from sophomore to junior year\n\n**Awards/Honors** (nothing crazy lol, I never really focused on academic awards)\n\n1. NMSC Semifinalist -> later Finalist\n2. Sport state awards\n3. AP awards (AP Scholar with Honor, AP Scholar with Distinction)\n4. IL State Scholar\n5. Local conference sport awards\n\n**LORS**\n\n* AP US History teacher: 10/10, she allowed me to read it and asked if I wanted her to make any changes, but it was perfectly fine the way she wrote it (she's also one of my favorite teachers ever)\n* AP Stats and AP CSP teacher: probably a 9/10, I've had her for sophomore and senior year and she wrote me a letter even though I asked her during senior year fall (I didn't know she only took LOR requests if you asked in your junior year)\n\n**Interviews**\n\nHarvard Zoom interview - 9/10 interview imo, was my first college interview ever so I was super nervous, but it turned out to be very chill?? The interviewer asked me the classic 'Tell me about yourself' to start off and after I finished, we branched off my answer into entirely non-academic but very enjoyable and intriguing conversations (e.g. traveling, skiing, coffee, tea). We also then talked about why Harvard (there was a specific program there I referred to for this) and other colleges. I don't know how his perspective of me turned out as a result of the interview, but I personally was very relieved that at least I enjoyed the interview lol.\n\nI'm a coward so no other interviews (I selected no to interviews for many college applications)\n\nI think interviewers from Yale and WashU reached out to me, but I didn't see those until after college app season rip\n\n**Essays** (More on these at the end!)\n\n* Common App: I expanded on my fifth listed activity (English tutoring), since I had asked around and gotten advice from many college friends that the Common App is where you can display non-academic traits and personality best in your application. I took my experience with English tutoring very seriously and the what I've learned from it as a teacher really stuck with me throughout the years. The beginning of the essay was a narrative essay, and then ended with the lessons I've learned and how I'll take them with me into the future (beyond college)\n* Supplementals: I always felt like writing about activities listed lower on my activity list was a nice way to help round out and expand my application (this is also part of the reason I chose English tutoring for the Common App essay). I often wrote the beginning of the essays to be storytelling narratives (also like the Common App), since I felt those helped me express my feelings and experiences at those times best.\n\n**Decisions** (applied ECE / CE everywhere)\n\n*Acceptances*:\n\nU of Arizona\n\nPurdue EA\n\nGeorgia Tech EA\n\nUIUC EA\n\nCase Western RD\n\nUSC RD\n\nPrinceton RD -> commited!!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Waitlists*:\n\nWashU RD waitlist -> Acceptance\n\nRice RD\n\nCMU RD\n\nUCLA RD\n\nUPenn RD\n\n&#x200B;\n\n*Rejections:*\n\nStanford REA\n\nBrown RD\n\nMIT RD\n\nNorthwestern RD\n\nUMich EA deferred -> rejected\n\nUW Seattle RD\n\nDuke RD\n\nCornell RD\n\nYale RD\n\nHarvard RD\n\nBerkeley RD\n\n**Additional Information**:\n\nUp until junior year, I had absolutely no clue about anything concerning or relating to college. I had no idea which colleges were the Ivies or anything like the T20s (many of which I'd never heard of), what I needed to do for the applications, and even my major. I chose my major when I had to write about it for supplementals, since I just couldn't pick before then. As I trudged through college app season, I learned most of what I know now from YouTube videos, some subreddits, and the people around me.\n\n**Some general tips**:\n\n* Start early! Essays take time to write. I started brainstorming my Common App essay in late July, scrapped my idea in early August, and only finished it in late October (right before EAs lmao). I had a friend who was chilling since he finished all of his in September. Be that friend. During senior year fall, you're stacked with homework, college apps, and probably even more. I kept finishing applications barely before the deadline, which took quite a toll on my mentality and my academics.\n* Do research on the colleges! I knew almost nothing about all the colleges I applied to. Many of the colleges on my list were picked based on my parents' opinions and friends I knew who went to a certain college, since I just didn't know where to apply. I'd say it's good to research your plans for both academic and extracurricular experiences in (insert college), so you can mention them in your essays and you have some plans for life beyond academics if you get in.\n* I think essays are the most convincing way for you to get into any school, as I'm almost sure my essays were the driving factor behind my acceptance. Since I never considered academic achievements beyond getting good grades, I didn't have any competitions, awards, research, internships, etc to show for, so I tried my best to focus on writing essays that could demonstrate my character in compelling and intriguing ways.\n\n**Essay info**:\n\nRemember that at the end of the day, the goal of the application is to market yourself to the AOs! I found that the best way for me to do that was to do narrative essays where I could communicate my emotions most interestingly and creatively. For brainstorming, I listed several topics I could write about and started to write each one as if it were my final essay. After that, I could narrow down what topics and essays felt 'right' to me, and which ones could display my character the most accurately.\n\nThis may be personal preference, but I like being more dynamic, dramatic, or even cliche in the essays. Emotive and expressive writing is great for connecting with the AOs, and I think it’s a great way to market yourself as a vivid, appealing, and memorable person, which will definitely make you pop as a person more than just your stats (the AOs will no doubt have seen many, many impressive ones, so the essays are extremely important and compelling in advertising yourself to them). However, it’s still important to REALLY, REALLY, REALLY hammer in how essential your chosen essay topic is to your character and growth as a person.\n\nUltimately, make the AOs want YOU on their campus!!! Don’t just say what you find interesting about and would gain from (insert college), persuade them that you’ll be an excellent contribution to their community! It’s all about mutual exchanges and give and take; convince them that you’ll leave the campus a better place in your own unique way (for supplementals, be as specific as you can about how you’d imagine doing so!)\n\nI cannot even begin to explain how much I relate to this terrible, tedious process of learning, brainstorming, editing, scrapping ideas, and starting over with college apps. Although I can't guarantee I'll be able to answer everything, if you have any questions, I’d be happy to help!\n\nEdit: fixed some formatting issues", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/18xbsee/asian_girl_wo_competitive_ecs_shotguns_because/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/18xbsee/asian_girl_wo_competitive_ecs_shotguns_because/", "upvotes": 164, "num_comments": 26, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "2024 results"}

Summer Research Program at UT Austin, semi-selective, presented research on dark matter concentration in galactic clusters using the virial theorem and completed an intro astrophysics and data analysis course. Was credited for their FRI research course as well. First author and head of my research group.\n2. Paid Internship at a unicorn company from 10th-12th grade, around 15hrs/wk during school and 25 during breaks. Worked with Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics content development for test products and spearheaded the development of certain textbooks that are being published.\n3. Published a 225 page textbook on AP Chemistry to amazon and Barnes and nobles, over 10000 lines of code in Latex . I'm the First Author, Illustrator, and Editor\n4. Research paper that's being pre-printed confirmed to be soon published to a semi-prestigious journal around December, basically a continuation of my work at UT Austin but expanded and more in-depth. I'm the first author and am working with 3 other people I met during the summer program.\n5. Co-founded a nonprofit org at my school where I teach in-person and online for around 4-6 hours per week and create content in the form of review books and packets online for Physics and Mathematics posted to the website. We have over 150 active members in our discord server and 12 student teachers for various subjects. I'm the vice president and also oversee the advanced math and physics department. I wrote part of my main essay about this\n6. I have an art, photography, and cinematography portfolio on a website I made online. There's about 5 short films (3-5 mins) and 4 landscape photography galleries each with 10-15 edited works. I use a drone for a lot of my footage. My art gallery is also pretty big (15-20 works) and I have some state level art awards on there. It's a compilation of some stuff before highschool as well, since I was about 11 years old. I'd like to think they're good, as some pieces took months to make.\n7. I'm part of the YMSL (young men's service league) for all 4 years of high school, have completed over 200 hours of service with them, and held a leadership position the whole time. I also lead bimonthly meetings and infomercials for younger members, and as a result of the connections I got from this, have a TON of volunteer hours with many other organizations (around 4 of which I had a significant impact in)\n8. I also volunteer at another org called GRACE, where I helped start some new programs and centers near my city. Lotsa service hours as well.\n9. Pre-College summer program at Duke in Particle Physics, did some research on the SuperCDMS particle detector\n10. I'm a paid tutor in Mathematics at a local business I co-founded, I work for roughly 1hr/wk and teach a range of students from elementary to high school.\n\r  \n\r  \n**Essays/LORs/Other:**  LOR for IB Math and Physics - 10, same teacher for both, was the top student in both classes and I worked with her to write the letter for a few months. She's also my extended essay supervisory and predicted me an A. My other LOR is from my AP Chem teacher (7/10), who should be fine since I wrote a textbook based on his class and method of teaching, and finally from my English teacher (8/10) who is known for writing great letters. I have an additional one from my employment, which was apparently a 10 from those who read it.\n\nI spent quite some time revising my Harvey Mudd essays, i think my common app main one and one of the supplementals are really good, while the other supplemental was somewhat good but not great.\n\r  \nI do not plan to ask for any financial aid.\n\n**Schools:** \nAccepted: \n- UT Austin (EA)\n- UTD (Full Ride)\n- Penn State\n- Harvey Mudd (ED1, Committed)\n- Georgia Tech \n- UIUC Grainger\n- Michigan Ann Arbor\n- CU Boulder w/ honors\n- UWisconsin Madison\n\nOther schools I was going to apply to if HMC didn't work out:\n\nRD: UCB, UCLA, UCSB, UCSD, UPenn, Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Stanford, UChicago, Johns Hopkins, Carnegie Mellon, WashU St. Louis, MIT, and Caltech.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/18h8ygl/asian_physics_major_gets_into_every_echool/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/18h8ygl/asian_physics_major_gets_into_every_echool/", "upvotes": 89, "num_comments": 68, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "2024 results"}

Really felt nervous about this tanking my application because a few friends said it was really really bad (not to be mean, they were genuinely trying to help). However, this was cancelled out by a few adults and college students saying it was really good, so idk. Overall was probably decent, and appealed to more serious readers.\n\nSupplementals: A majority were good, probably around 7-8/10. A few were super cringe looking back, so like 3/10, while a couple were genuinely 10/10. Even got a note from my Stanford AO saying she loved my essays. Lots of research and time put into the \"Why Us?\" essays. Took a huge risk on my why major essay, and it ended up leading to mixed results. The community essay was probably my weakest, while the essays in which I got to explain my family situation, express my passion for econ, and the 50ish-word short responses were my best. As a whole, I think my supplements and how I approached them through expressing my personality and passions rather than flexing my accomplishments really helped me stand out.\n\nJust a note on the essays: the amount of time you spend on an essay has no correlation to how good it is. It's perfectly fine to finish one quickly and use a first or second draft. Some of my best essays were written like this when I was just in a good mood and trying to finish quickly to go hang out - while the ones I grinded on for days (looking at you Princeton) ended up being fake and cringey.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Decisions:**\n\n**Acceptances**:\n\nUPenn Wharton ED Deferral ---> Acceptance\n\nUMich Ross EA\n\nIU Kelley EA\n\nUT Austin Business Honors EA\n\nTexas A&M EA\n\nStanford RD (committed!!)\n\nDartmouth RD\n\nCarnegie Mellon Tepper RD\n\nVanderbilt RD\n\nNotre Dame RD\n\nGeorgetown McDonough RD\n\nRice Business School RD\n\n**Waitlists**:\n\nHarvard RD ----> waitlisted then rejected\n\nCornell RD - opted out\n\nColumbia RD - opted out\n\nBrown RD - opted out\n\nDuke RD - opted out\n\n**Rejections**:\n\nMIT RD\n\nPrinceton RD\n\nYale RD\n\nNYU Stern RD\n\n**Additional Information/final reflections:**\n\nI think the biggest, biggest thing that I regret, and am still trying to overcome, is the glorification of Ivy students. What I mean by this is the echo chamber prevalent on this sub, and A2C and even among the students I met at the various competitions I participated in, that believes that anyone who gets into a school like Harvard or Stanford or any Ivy for that matter is somehow smarter or better than kids who get rejected. This belief led me to believe that only those with super stacked god-tier resumes get in, leading me to be completely shocked by my results. Looking back, even though I'm not a perfect applicant, I should've been a lot more confident and realized that I was definitely \"average\" for an Ivy applicant. I have a deleted post on an alt asking where I'd get in, and most people said Kelley and Ross at best. I think people as a whole need to realize that although college admissions is super selective and complete BS, the reason you won't get in is NOT because you didn't do enough, or because your resume is weak - it's because of factors like luck and institutional priorities. If I applied again, I could see myself getting into Stanford or Harvard again, or ending up at A&M or UT. It's literally all luck once you're past a certain point. I hope all applicants in the future are more optimistic (without being unrealistic), while taking the admissions process a little more lightheartedly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne final thing: if you're a prestige whore. Stop it now. It never ends. This is going to sound so fucking dumb, but until like last week, while I was waiting for Harvard waitlist results to come out, I genuinely had the thought that I wasn't \"good enough\" because I got into Stanford and not Harvard. WTF. I can't believe I genuinely thought something like that. Objectively I know it's false because I can see people on this sub with similar applications to me get into Harvard and not Stanford, and even without that, it's just so dumb to place my value on an admissions decision. I've really sat and thought about it for a while, and I think being a prestige whore comes from a mix of needing validation and also feeling insecure. I've been working towards addressing both, and hope in the future I won't give a shit what people think and will stop being in my own head.\n\nAnyways, sorry for the rambling at the end of this post! Good luck to the class of 2024 and all future classes applying! I hope everything works out amazing for you all, and dm or comment if you have any questions.

Hooks really do make a difference, and even though I was passionate about a small group of things (the work I did at my law firm internship, debate, research, track), overall I think I didn't do enough in those fields to stand out. Also, I don't really feel that my EC's matched my major, in that for the first two years of high school I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do.\n\nPlease don't apply to only one safety as I did.

When I finally remembered, it was already the end of January and 3 weeks past the deadline. At that point, I was pretty sure I had thrown away any chance I had (at least I didn’t try to kiss my interviewer though).\n\nFast forward to Ivy Day, I had 10 decisions to open and completely forgot about Yale. Of the ones I opened, I got 6 WLs, 1 rejection, and 2 acceptances (Tufts + Northeastern), so I was pretty bummed and assumed that I’d be going to Northeastern. When I finally remembered Yale about an hour later, I was almost certain it would be a waitlist or rejection based on my other results and the research supplement debacle. But by some miracle, I was greeted by a video titled \"Welcome 2024\" instead of the “we regret to inform you” that I was so accustomed to.\n\nI definitely predicted fewer waitlists, way more rejections, and a few more acceptances, but I’m overall very happy with the final outcome.

Student Assoc (TSA) (9-12) - minor officer position in 12th grade, helped run practices and prepared for competitions\n* Math Club (9-12) - no leadership position, competed in math contests consistently but not really OP like some of my classmates\n* Unnamed volunteering organization (10-12) - data analysis related leadership position, volunteered a lot during the year and summers, basically did some computational stuff with the database to help the org. quantify  its impact and track stuff better (sorry if I'm being kinda vague) <--- the volunteer coordinator was really impressed by the stuff I did so I got a supplemental rec from her\n* Advocacy club at my school (10-12) - leadership position on the executive board, pretty standard stuff, kinda relates to my political science interests and we do some volunteer work as well\n* Ethics Bowl (9-12) - Co-captain of senior team, we qualed to nats 2 yrs but didn't win anything\n* Orchestra (9-12) - played cello since middle school, never really amazing at it but I enjoyed playing just for fun I guess, didn't really have any all-district or all-state stuff like some other ppl did\n\n**Subjective:**\n\n* Both teacher LORs were probably above average but not exceptional (\\~7.5/10), it's kinda hard to stand out since my HS is so competitive, but teachers had pretty good opinions of me and I provided them with really thorough brag sheets to help them write their recs\n* Counselor LOR was 7/10, didn't really interact with counselor a lot but gave him a thorough brag sheet and he knows I'm a good student, so probably above average\n* Supplemental LOR from volunteer coordinator was like 9.5/10, she let me read it and it was really heartfelt and passionate about my work in that volunteering org. Don't know how much this compensated for my other LORs but I think it helped at least a little\n* Essays probably varied in quality a lot, my Yale and UNC/UVA/Georgia Tech ones were kinda rough since I wrote those earlier, but RD ones were significantly better I think. I'd say overall 8.5/10, as I'd like to think of myself as a pretty good writer.\n* I think my common app was a pretty creative reflection of my dual interests in applied math & polisci, so probably like 8.5-9/10 but different AO's might've had different opinions of it since it was a bit unconventional, idk.\n\n**Results:**\n\nAccepted - Georgia Tech (EA), UNC (EA), UVA (EA instate), Carnegie Mellon (College of Sciences), Rice, UPenn (Arts & Sciences)\n\nRejected - Yale (defer-->reject), Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, Duke, MIT\n\nWaitlisted - Johns Hopkins, Vanderbilt, Brown, Columbia\n\n**Other stuff:**\n\n* I applied to TASP but didn't get in, so I didn't really get to participate in any competitive summer programs like RSI & TASP. I mainly just continued my volunteering stuff, independent research, & dental clinic interning which I guess was pretty decent.\n* This may look like a lot of leadership positions but my high school has a ton of clubs so it's not as difficult to get positions as it might be in larger schools\n* In retrospect, I probably should've ED'd to Columbia instead of waiting till RD since that was my dream school, but my parents were against the idea and financially we're full-pay so I was also looking into scholarships. That's partially why I did Yale REA.\n\n**Overall:**\n\n* I think I did pretty well for an unhooked Asian male coming from a competitive part of VA, and I'm most likely going to be part of the UPenn Class of 2024!!!\n* I'm declining all the waitlists except for Columbia, but since I was lucky enough to get into UPenn, I'm fine even if Columbia's waitlist doesn't work out.\n* In my case as an unhooked applicant, I think shotgunning definitely was better than doing only a few apps, but maybe things would've been different if I just ED'd Columbia and ended there. \n* Ironically, UPenn was the very last app I did (since the deadline was Jan 5) and I was pretty burned out while writing the essays. I prolly rushed those compared to my other RD essays, but maybe they turned out better because of that.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/frd15g/results_from_an_asian_male_shotgunning_ivies_t20s/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/frd15g/results_from_an_asian_male_shotgunning_ivies_t20s/", "upvotes": 14, "num_comments": 0, "flair": null, "query_matched": "2024 results"}

NH Coach was able to convince ARML to open an official location nearby, since we couldn't afford transportation anywhere else.\n\n\\- You may be noticing that USAMO is in the title but not here.

Asked in August before senior year. Don't know how strong it is. He knew me since I was a sophomore, when I started doing competition math.\n\n\\- High school math teacher: Probably my strongest one. I had the same math teacher's classes for all four years of high school, was one of the advisors of the math team I founded, and we were very close. I didn't know while applying for college, but while applying for scholarships I got to read the essay. It was very well written and mentioned some activities that I didn't write as an EC (and some that I did). Including:\n\n\\- Wrote a full AP Calculus AB mock exam in my junior year. Forgot I did this while applying. I just did it for fun.\n\n\\- Helped teach AP Calculus BC to 3 other students, since my school otherwise wouldn't have had enough people to run the class and it ran at the same time as Calculus AB. I thought this was more of an academics thing and couldn't write this as an EC. Maybe I was wrong and almost fumbled my app idk.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n\\- MIT: 8/10. I didn't get stuck on any questions but most of the interview was me asking the interviewer questions, and I feel like I didn't get to express a whole lot. He linked how I mentioned messing around with ChatGPT for fun by asking it to write a random essay, then giving it that same essay and asking it to explain why it could not possibly by AI generated, just to see how well AI can lie.\n\n\\- Dartmouth: 10/10. This one went VERY well. I was able to use everything I had in my arsenal pretty much exactly once, didn't really struggle with any questions, and got to express myself very well. My school didn't host the AMC and I took it at the school where my interviewer graduated, so we both knew the math teacher there. Best interview performance of my life. I know it went well because my interviewer offered to help tour parts of campus that weren't included in the usual tour (I mentioned during the interview that I was visiting Dartmouth soon.)\n\n\\- Yale: 6/10. Wasn't anything bad, but the order the questions were asked in had me tripping over my own shoelaces and kind of using the same information multiple times. Felt like I didn't do bad, but didn't stand out.\n\n\\- UPenn: 5/10. This one wasn't called an interview official and was called like an alumni conversation or something. Did this over phone instead of zoom, and kept having issues with my interviewer not being able to make out what I said due to the poor audio quality. My actual performance was similar to Yale, but I was cutoff sometimes and I didn't know if it was because of the poor audio quality or because I was talking too much idk I felt like I wasn't talking that much.\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal statement: My Junior year English teacher is the GOAT and had a unit dedicated to having us write our essays as part of English class. I had a kind of oddball topic and talked about hiking, my relation to nature, and how it kind of relates to escaping/refueling for maximum productivity, since this was not reflected elsewhere in my app. Got this reviewed by some teachers and overall felt it was mid-good. I didn't use ChatGPT to assist while making it, but after submitting my apps I asked it to rate my personal statement and it said 80/100. I'm not the best writer style-wise I'm a math kid lol.\n\nSupplementals: This is where I messed up. I didn't know too much about the college application process since I didn't really have anyone I could regularly talk to about it. I ended up doing supplementals for 15 schools within like a week. Partly due to my lack of process knowledge and partly just from ordinary procrastination. Didn't get these reviewed by anyone besides myself or use any tools besides google docs spelling and grammar check lol.\n\nI talked about Martial Arts and the lessons in optimism it taught me a lot, but I was careful not to repeat any topic twice per college. I feel like I was particularly creative with my brown university 3 words to describe yourself supplemental and said  \"Ponder, Ding, Boom.\" to try to stand out a bit.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\nEA:\n\nApplied to some safeties. Applied to 11 schools, mostly random nearby safety schools cause they had no app fee, I didn't know common-app had a 20 college limit, and for some reason I thought I might get rejected from UNH. Swept all safeties. Notable acceptance (ones I care about most) include:\n\nUNH (Hamel scholars program + $$$$$), and RPI ($$$ + Medalist)\n\nRD:\n\nHarvard\\*: >!Rejected!<\n\nNortheastern\\*: >!Waitlisted!<\n\nDartmouth\\*: >!Waitlisted!<\n\nCornell\\*: >!Waitlisted!<\n\nCarnegie Mellon: >!Waitlisted!<\n\nCaltech: >!Rejected!<\n\nBrown\\*: >!Rejected!<\n\nURochester\\*: >!Accepted + $!<\n\nUPenn\\*: >!Rejected!<\n\nUIUC: >!Rejected!<\n\nBoston University\\*: >!Waitlisted!<\n\nMIT\\*: >!Rejected!<\n\nTufts\\*: >!Waitlisted!<\n\nGeorgia Tech: >!Rejected!<\n\nUMass Amherst: >!Accepted + $$$!<\n\nUniversity of Vermont: >!Accepted + $$$!<\n\nUMich Ann Arbor\\*: >!Waitlisted!<\n\nYale\\*: >!ACCEPTED!!<\n\nRecall that \\* means they got and accepted an email or pdf (I think these are called LOCI?) detailing senior year accomplishments\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI was a schoolhouse Tutor as well for SAT Math but only MIT had a spot to put this. Didn't know about these, so I didn't do the peer rec for Dartmouth or video for Brown oops.\n\nMy advice: Start EVERYTHING Early. College list? Junior year. Recs? Junior year. Essays? Soon as prompts come out. I missed out on so many opportunities and optional requirements just because I didn't know about them and majorly messed up so many things when I should have known better. My performance on the actual app process was awful and I almost sold four years of hard work over a few months of confusion. Is it fair? Absolutely Not. It is true? Yes. I am so thankful for the teachers at my school who I mentioned in this post. Also make a spreadsheet of places you applied including links to the portal.

UCLA (Berk is superior anyway :))))\n7. Notre Dame\n8. NYU (CAS)\n9. Georgetown (ugly ass campus, im totally not salty at all after they accepted this jerk who barely studies and is mean to everyone from my school)\n10. Johns Hopkins\n11. Williams\n12. Vanderbilt\n13. Barnard\n\nREJECTED FROM\n\n1. Yale SCEA (can't believe I thought I had a chance)\n2. Harvard\n3. Stanford\n4. Columbia\n5. UPenn\n6. Duke (my dream school -\\_-)\n7. Northwestern (Dream school #2 -\\_-)\n8. Tufts\n\n**CURRENT TOP CHOICE:** ~~UC Berkeley (economics ranked very high) but I also love Rice's community (fell in love with Rice while I wrote my essays). Really hoping a waitlist pulls through though.~~\n\nCOMMITTING TO BROWN!!!!\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\nWhile I am grateful for the options I have, I honestly came into this cycle expecting more (before I got off the WL for Brown) because of shotgunning to 34 schools and the past admissions trends from my school. However, this process has been EXTREMELY humbling and TRULY helped me understand how merit can ONLY DO SO MUCH in college admissions. Every waitlist and rejection HURT, which made every acceptance feel even more unbelievable. Most of this is just institutional priorities, the environment you grew up in, the year you applied, and how your admissions officer felt that day. College admissions is TRULY RANDOM. This is why it is so important to just live and enjoy your high school life instead of stressing about which college you go to. Luck, happiness, and passion are your best friends, and your future college will recognize that.\n\nFYI, going to an Ivy does NOT make anyone more superior than anyone else. These students are literally normal, but hardworking and passionate, people who got lucky (being kind is apparently optional though...😒). I thought I could become one, but seeing the people from my school and my area who got in made me realize that I still have no fucking clue what colleges want.\n\nBut, you can basically get a great future anywhere, whether that be through community college, a top 20, top 50, or top 100 universities. JUST DON'T GIVE UP!!!!!!\n\n**UPDATED Additional Notes**\n\nI am so so grateful to have been taken off the waitlist, and honestly, I’m shaking. However, I still stand by what I said in the additional notes. Admissions are TRULY TRULY random and DOES NOT reflect merit. I readily chose Brown because of its open curriculum and WONDERFUL undergraduate experience, BUT UC Berkeley’s economics is ELITE.\n\nHope this helped for any future college applicants!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jolz54/mixed_results_of_a_new_england_asian_female_in/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jolz54/mixed_results_of_a_new_england_asian_female_in/", "upvotes": 33, "num_comments": 10, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "2025 results"}

She talked about how I stuck with student media even though I couldn't be graded member of the class and transformed the media team, as well as a lot of amazing stuff about my personality. Love her <3\n\nCivics/AP Euro Teacher - 6/10: This wasn't up to par because I thought she would give me a great letter of rec but I later found out a lot of it was just copy and paste. She did, however, add in a paragraph about how I wasn't afraid to be wrong and was very open-minded. It wasn't a bad letter by any means! just not at the level the others were at.\n\nChoir teacher/my literal second mom - 9.5/10: She's taken me across the state of PA to choir festivals, she's given me courage to be who I am, and... the letter is just so amazing. She talked about how she entrusts me with her children (I babysit for her) and it was just so great.\n\nPeer rec - 8.5/10: My vice president of student media. Her writing style is very unique. Her final sentence was \"Your campus deserves an \\[NAME\\] so someone can get through their college experience, just like how he helped me get through my high school one.\" We're so close and I'm so grateful she agreed to write one for me. **NOTE: I sent this peer rec not only to Dartmouth (which wanted one) but also Harvard, Stanford, and Northwestern. Some people may have seen this as unprofessional. I really had hope it would help me. All I can say is look at the results below and do with them what you will.**\n\nInterviews\n\nBowdoin College (4/10): This interview was my first and it was super shaky with online connection. I talked a little too quickly and accidentally made my words come across as if I got burnt out easily. Overall it went well, but we didn't connect much and the interview was fairly short.\n\nStanford University (8/10): I felt super confident after this one. I made sure my Bowdoin interview mistakes weren't a problem here, and I really connected with my interviewer! He said he would \"only put good things in for my admission file.\"\n\nBrown University Video Response (#/10): I really can’t rate this. It could have been 5/10, it could’ve been 10/10; I’m too biased to give a good rating. I recorded it on my phone (in one take) in the cemetery I did my Eagle Project, showed two examples of my work, and then launched into a conversation about how the church the cemetery is connected to believes “all homosexuals will go to hell” yet I decided to serve the church and complete my project there because I knew it would benefit the community more than the church itself. Closed it all out by saying I learned how accessible making an impact is from it all. A lot of my friends said it was a little scatter-brained. I was colddddd though, I had been in a freezing cemetery for an hour lol\n\nEssays\n\nPersonal Essay (9.5/10): It was about how I dealt with myself and the people around me discovering I had perfect pitch when I was 16. I delved a lot into my childhood synesthesia and how it translated into my interests today. I talked about dealing with other people's opinions and deciding to prioritize myself while responding to people how I wanted to respond.\n\nAs for my other essays, I'd like to think they were pretty good. I talked a lot about growing up queer in a rural, non-accepting area, caring for my grandparents, gardening with emphasis on local impact, and discovering something life-changing in a book I read. Of course, I forced myself not to go back and look at them because that just leads to terrible looping thought patterns lol. I spent so much time writing them, but I notably didn't go back and rewrite as much as I probably should have. I'd give them, overall, an 8.5/10.\n\nDecisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)\n\n**Acceptances:**\n\nSeveral local schools, including one full ride\n\nArizona State University (Rolling) (21K a year scholarship)\n\nIthaca College (EA) (30K a year scholarship)\n\nUniversity of South Carolina and their Honors College (EA) (Tuition reduced to in-state and 2K extra off)\n\nPenn State and their Honors College (EA) (Still haven't gotten any financial info :/ love PA in-state options)\n\nSyracuse University (RD) (30K a year scholarship + Honors College Invite)\n\nColorado College (EA)\n\nBrown University (RD)!!!

Colleges are great at looking at everything in context and measuring relative achievement. I also think my class rank should prove to prospective applicants that T20s will not throw away applications just because their class rank is not up to par, even without context.\n\n2025 Edit: Rural/Uncompetitive school applicants, if you have an SAT above 1400, I recommend submitting (double check your high school’s average SAT first). Also, I don’t recommend submitting a peer rec unless the school asks for one. Because even with FERPA, the AO can guess you’ve read over what your friend has said about you.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1brpqr2/rural_lgbtq_dude_tries_to_escape_his_hometown_and/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1brpqr2/rural_lgbtq_dude_tries_to_escape_his_hometown_and/", "upvotes": 17, "num_comments": 8, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|SocSci", "query_matched": "2025 results"}

Congressional App Challenge Winner for District\n\nFor UC’s I listed AIME qualifications and Hackathon results here.\n\n***Letters of Recommendation***\n\nLOR 1 - AP Chem teacher - loved him, I hope he loved me, I used him for my isef project and alot of other stuff, and he seemed very interested, he’s known to write good rec’s so id say 8/10 being conservative\n\nLOR 2 - US History Teacher - only non ap history i took but he was genuinely so amazing of a teacher, he liked me, i read his rec since he let me, it was pretty good 6/10\n\nLOR 3 - EC#1 research mentor - old guy who really liked me and said he specifically tailored my rec for MIT and Caltech whatever that means \\[he sent 4 people to mit over the past 4 years so ig he knows\\], love him sm and he said he spent a really long time on it so hopefully 9/10.\n\nLOR 4 - counselor - I talk to my counselor alot and I think she likes me alot, and she’s super super nice so I’m just going to say 7/10.\n\n​\n\n***Interviews***\n\nMIT - spent 3.5 hours, my mom lowk got annoyed, but it was amazing he told me about a new way to think about space time, MIT experience, hacking and everything, met him later at admit day for our region and he said he really enjoyed the interview and expected me to get in. 9/10.\n\nHarvard - he said i would “fit the modern school” interview went for 45 minutes, got him to talk about some illegal stuff he did @ harvard but he cut it off when zoom ran out so not sure how good, felt like i vibed. 6/10.\n\nStanford - went really well, the AO note later said she described me as a genius apparently so that’s cool, we talked alot and she had done isef i think in the past and we talked about our memories alot and in general it was fun. 9/10.\n\nDuke - pretty mid tbh it was fun and nice but i had no answer for why duke 5/10\n\nUC Berkeley MET - Disaster, this is not a one on one, but you record yourself answering questions, I REALLY didn’t care since I came back later had 1 day to do this and was tired, just chatgpt’d some random stuff about the school and said it reading straight from a script, super uninspiring answers read in an uninspiring way (tbf I wasn’t interested in MET since it meant my parents might force me to go there over stanford) 1/10\n\n​\n\n***Essays***\n\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\n\nI nearly failed APEL and I’m not known to be a great writer, so ​I dropped all my ec’s senior year to focus on essays, after being warned by a guy @ davidsons that essays mattered way more than I thought they did. Watched every video from admitium tiktok to cc posts and hundreds of reddit threads to get ideas and help. I got help from my friends and also a really cool family friend @ harvard who got praised for writing alot. My essays were very nontraditional and very very casual and i talked about lots of mitish stuff (dream school), which also happened to fit for caltech. Everyone who read my CA said they liked it, and my Harvard friend who got in purely for essays (his note said) rated them really highly said he liked my essays, but I don’t think they were the main driving factor for my acceptances so I’ll rate them 7/10 (like everyone else on this forum). \n\nSince I didn’t have to tell the colleges how much i loved researching or science bc my awards and ec’s displayed that already, i spent most of my essays talking about fun stuff i liked doing, and nonacademic stuff, trying to talk about myself as a person and not as a college applicant/sweaty high schooler.\n\nI didn’t try on my Duke or Columbia or NU essays AT ALL, i templated my why essays really hard and just swapped in names, but I did copy paste my MIT essays into duke which i spent almost 100 hours on. I tryharded my MIT Stanford Caltech and Harvard essays, and I’d rate them 8/10, while my other schools (including UC’s) were much much worse probably 3/10 or 4/10.\n\n***Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)***\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (RD) -> first choice \\[depends on finaid for commit\\]**\n* **Stanford University (REA)**\n* **California Institute of Technology (RD)**\n* **Harvard University (RD)** \n* UC Irvine (RD)\n* UC San Diego (RD)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* UC Los Angeles (RD)\n* Duke University (RD)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* UC Berkeley (RD & Rejected MET)\n* Northwestern (RD)\n* Columbia (RD)\n\nAdditional Information:\n\nIn general, I don’t think this collegeresults posts helps anyone except maybe like 20 people be more confident in their profiles, but I wanted to say either way GOOD. ESSAYS. REALLY. REALLY. REALLY. MATTER. I know alot of people with similar ec’s as me and while they lit up the T5’s as well, there is always people that don’t, if you have these sorts of awards&ec’s you need to be showing off your personality, don’t just sit there with your isef medal and watch the world go by and chatgpt essays and expect to sweep T5’s (or t3’s since Yale and Princeton are irrelevant smh) \n\nUC’s are so random—I live in CA and I hate UC’s for being so RNG, almost NO one is getting in, and it’s just so random no matter which ones. I have no clue what is going on but test op hit these schools like a truck. Until the test is reinstated in \\~2025 UC will probably be stupid and random like it is right now for Co22/23/24. College Board backlash was unjustified. \n\nAlso try on everything!! I got my MET interview, and then absolutely bombed it by just reading straight from a script and obviously rushing to get it done, and I might have had some random stanford stuff in the background too LOL so that was not the best look and probably why I got straight rejected (read: coping)\n\nSimilarly, not trying at all on Duke/NU/Columbia is why I got rejected by those, like seriously those were 2/10 essays, you can’t just get by without good essays, I did this almost as a test, if I could have awful essays and clearly a good enough app for more selective schools, and yeah it DOESN’T WORK. TRY ON YOUR ESSAYS!!\n\nOkay actually not columbia, funny story, they didn’t get my SCOIR rec for whatever reason, and sent me 3 emails asking me to submit it (want me fr) but I didn’t respond on time so yeah. (sorry I kept forgetting and the deadline hit)\n\nAt the same time, Columbia is the worst school in the world (read rejected my best friend ed) so i dnc.\n\nIn general, I wasn’t \\*that\\* surprised by any acceptance after stanford, but mit still had my heart destroying itself. \n\nShould you do the no targets/no safeties strat? Yeah go for it j take 20 gap years like that one usc (or was it nyu i can never tell) post.\n\no/  \n\n\nPS CALCKID123 TAKES NO L'S\n\n&#x200B;\n\ngood luck everyone!!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1283vm9/asian_male_with_no_targetssafeties_artfully_sinks/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1283vm9/asian_male_with_no_targetssafeties_artfully_sinks/", "upvotes": 138, "num_comments": 35, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "2025 results"}

Quizbowl - Team captain and led team to 14th place at nationals; ranked top 10 in regular season; coached teams and players - even made youtube videos to help people study\n2. Academic Competition Federation - I wrote quizbowl questions for the main college quizbowl organization (I am the first high school student to write for their Regional's tournament, which is the qualifying tournament for the college national championship)\n3. Science Olympiad - Was on school's varsity Science Olympiad team. I coached the event Astronomy where all 5 teams from my school swept the top 5 places at our regional's competition. Also qualified for State's but COVID cancelled it.\n4. USAAAO - Qualified for the United States Astrophysics and Astronomy Olympiad!\n5. Taking care of brother - My brother has autism so I spend a lot of time each day taking care of him\n6. Math club - Qualified for the American Invitational Mathematics Invitation\n7. Youth symphony - Principal trumpet in a major city's youth symphony\n8. Church - I am a student leader in my church and also a drummer!\n9. There were some other ones that I think were important but I cannot remember what they were. Maybe I included Ping Pong club or marching band? I can't remember\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n1. AP Scholar with Distinction\n2. \"Superior\" award at school's marching band's solo and ensemble competition\n3. I really can't remember the other things I filled in. Maybe I put in my quizbowl placements (state championship, national placements, etc.). Fun fact: I was a finalist for my school's homecoming court in my sophomore year though I don't think I put that in my application since that would be very cringe.\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nAP Statistics Teacher (6-7/10): This teacher knew me very well. She was the teacher I was closest with, and also served as the advisor and coach for Quizbowl, which I dedicated at least 15 hours to every week, so she knew how hard I worked. My main issue was that everyone told me she was not a very good writer, so I don't know how well she articulated her recommendation of me.\n\nAP English Literature Teacher (9/10): This teacher also knew me well. Perhaps not as well as the previous teacher, but we knew each other for two years. We would compete in trivia competitions together and both of us liked the same books. I dabbled in creative writing and this teacher would help me edit my work and always encouraged me to publish since he told me I was a good writer. I was always too nervous and to this day have never published anything even though I have so many short stories and manuscripts saved on my computer. This teacher was said to be a very strong writer, and getting his letter of recommendation was supposedly very difficult, so I do give him a high rating.\n\nCounselor (0/10): I've never met this woman in my life.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nMy interviews went pretty well. Most interviews were fairly generic discussions, but I had an interviewer that had a Wikipedia page and another interviewer cried when I told him my family situation since he said it was very touching. My Harvard interviewer was distracted the whole time and when I mentioned I considered law as a field, she was like \"that requires dedication and a work ethic and\" \\*scoffs\\* \"I don't know...\" She did not keep talking, but I was pretty upset with her insinuation and ended the interview early. My Princeton interviewer was amazing. We talked for many hours, and we even emailed for a few weeks after talking about books. When I got rejected, he even brought up checking with AOs about if the rejection was real (I told him not to). He still told me to keep in contact with him if I ever needed his help in finding a job in the future. I love that guy.\n\n**Essays**\n\nI had two really good essays that I would alternate as my main essays based on which essays I could also incorporate into my supplementals. One of them was about my brother's autism and how kids with autism are not given fair opportunities, so I worked with kids with autism and that made me want to pursue a field where I could help others. The other essay was about my love of trivia, and how I worked hard to go from a player on my school's third quizbowl team to be the captain on a team that was ranked top 10 nationally. They sound kind of boring right now, but I felt like they were very good essays when put into context. Plus, I even paid professionals to edit my essays and they said the essays were good too. Most of my supplemental essays were very good too. I honestly believe that the strongest part of my application was my essays, so who knows?\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\nI applied for every school that my parents said they would be proud of me if I attended except for CalTech. Basically every good UC, two OOS public universities, and every top private university except CalTech. Also added in Swarthmore and Pomona (my own choice).\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* University of California - San Diego (RD)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Cornell University (ED) (deferral) (later rejected)\n* Massachusetts Institute of Technology (EA) (deferral) (later rejected)\n* University of Chicago (EA) (deferral) (later rejected)\n* Harvard University (RD)\n* Yale University (RD)\n* Princeton University (RD)\n* Columbia University (RD)\n* University of Pennsylvania (RD)\n* Brown University (RD)\n* Dartmouth College (RD)\n* Stanford University (RD)\n* Duke University (RD)\n* Johns Hopkins University (RD)\n* Northwestern University (RD)\n* Vanderbilt University (RD)\n* Rice University (RD)\n* Pomona College (RD)\n* Swarthmore College (RD)\n* Carnegie Mellon University (RD) (waitlisted first, later rejected)\n* University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (EA) (deferral) (waitlisted first, later rejected)\n* University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill (EA) (waitlisted first, later rejected)\n* University of California - Berkeley (RD)\n* University of California - Los Angeles (RD)\n* University of California - Irvine (RD)\n* University of California - Santa Barbara (RD)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nIf I could apply again, I would definitely cut this college list down. I definitely had enough time to write all my essays and make them good, but it was way too expensive. I do regret applying ED to Cornell - I don't even like that school that much, it's just that I had legacy and that didn't even prove useful. If anything, I would say that the schools I liked the most were Princeton, University of Chicago, Rice, and Swarthmore. I would honestly be fine applying to just those 4 schools and the UCs, but I think my college application mindset was geared far more towards getting into schools that would make my dad happy.\n\nAfter all of these rejections, I was not feeling great. My school's Naviance shows me as having the highest stats out of all the people from my school to ever apply to half of these schools. At UC Irvine and UC Santa Barbara, I was at least 2 ACT points and 0.2 GPA points above the next highest statted rejection.\n\nI did not feel great after my college results, and was honestly very depressed. UCSD is a great school, but 29 rejections really hits hard. I was also very upset to see other students that I did not get along with get into better schools. It's even more upsetting when you overhear your Asian parents talking to the local Asian parent community and they're like \"oh, your son only got into UCSD. I'm so sorry. My son is actually very smart and got into all of these other schools.\" Trust me. Some of these parents around here love to gossip and I hate it. My parents still supported me. My only other sibling has autism, so they always tell me they'll be proud of me no matter where I end up, but regardless I was pretty upset.\n\nLast week I finished my first quarter at UCSD. I did not expect I would become a CS major, but CS is honestly getting a bit more interesting. I still might change my majors, but as of right now I am a double major in CS and religion. I heavily considered transferring, but the transfer experience does not sound that interesting to me. I have honestly started to enjoy UCSD a lot - I got extremely involved with a church here, found a new best friend, and learned to cook very fancy foods. But my college rejections still linger in my mind, and every once in a while, I still think to myself - \"what if I went to a different college.\" I know the experience would probably be more or less the same, though I would have preferred a more liberal arts experience (hence why I liked Princeton and Swarthmore so much). I probably actually would enjoy UCSD more because I love the people here, but regardless of all of that, I still can't say I've fully gotten over all of these rejections. Oh well. Hopefully this post will be of interest to some people.\n\nEdit: I will say, that my personal conclusion is that it was God's will that I would go to UCSD and that there is a purpose for me there. Of course, I know many here are not religious. But deep down, I can't fully say whether or not I actually believe that, or I am just lying to myself in order to comfort myself.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/rkg0ya/wanna_see_what_shotgunning_30_decisions_looks_like/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/rkg0ya/wanna_see_what_shotgunning_30_decisions_looks_like/", "upvotes": 132, "num_comments": 27, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|Other", "query_matched": "2025 results"}

Eventually I got a 3rd letter from my orchestra director, who isn't known for particularly persuasive rec letters but with whom I had a stronger relationship. There was also a counselor recommendation; I had a pretty warm relationship with my counselor.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nI was only offered an interview from UPenn; it was only about 15 minutes long and was over FaceTime. Tone was pretty casual and the interviewer seemed impressed by my research experience.\n\nSomewhat related to interviews, I sent a custom video profile to Brown and UChicago, and did Bowdoin's separate video profile prompt.\n\n**Essays**\n\nI started everything pretty late; that being said I think I wrote a pretty good personal statement. It was about the overactive imagination I've had since childhood, and how that manifested itself in the form of a fictional world which I've been developing in different ways in my mind and through my artwork since I was little; my language always tends to be a little flowery, but I got my point across and told a story that's pretty unique to me.\n\nI procrastinated heavily on my apps and wrote a lot of supplements the day before or the day they were due, but I reused a few essays/essay fragments over a bunch of different apps, most especially writing detailing my experience of creating a constructed language.\n\nIn addition, I wrote a 25-page extended essay in the style of a research paper about my constructed language and submitted it to Vassar, UChicago, the Ivies, and a couple others, as well as a Letter of Continued Interest to Yale (after being deferred SCEA) and UChicago (after being waitlisted). I'm fairly certain that both of these became really influential with respect to my results.\n\n**Decisions**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Texas A&M University - College of Liberal Arts (rolling, auto-admit)\n* Connecticut College (RD)\n* Vassar College (RD)\n* Cornell University - College of Arts & Sciences (RD)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* University of Chicago (RD, accepted off waitlist post-gap year!)\n* Colby College (RD)\n* Swarthmore College (RD)\n* UCLA (RD)\n* UC Berkeley (RD)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* UT Austin (RD, got into CAP program but rejected from Austin)\n* Johns Hopkins University (RD)\n* Bowdoin College (RD)\n* Pomona College (RD)\n* Williams College (RD)\n* Dartmouth College (RD)\n* University of Pennsylvania (RD)\n* Brown University (RD)\n* Harvard University (RD)\n* Yale University (SCEA deferred, then rejected)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nOther than A&M and Conn (my safeties), I got an endless stream of waitlists and rejections up till Vassar on March 31st, and then Cornell on Ivy Day. Yale and UChicago were my dream schools, so UChicago's waitlist and Yale's rejection especially stung for me, but after I got into Cornell, I was super happy and spent the next month interacting with the Cornell community.\n\nHowever, Cornell's financial aid office was struggling, and the whole month of April came and went without my aid package showing up. By the end of the month, I was kinda freaking out because I still had yet to commit anywhere; I asked both Vassar and Cornell for commitment extensions as I waited for Cornell's aid.\n\nBut on April 30th, the day before the commitment deadline for most colleges, everything changed. I got an email during my AP Research class (right before lunch) from my UChicago Admissions Officer asking to call me to give me an update regarding where they stood with the waitlist. I was totally shocked but responded immediately, and she called me during lunch and told me that while they were overenrolled for the Class of 2025, they wanted to offer me a seat in the Class of 2026. I was ecstatic!!\n\nFinancial Aid info was sent the following week (ironically, Cornell's came out too, within a couple minutes of it, but UChicago's ended up being better), and I accepted the offer exactly a week after I first got it, on May 7th.\n\nNow that the process is finally over, I've had a chance to reflect, especially with regards to my UChicago Application. I came to realize that many things came together in the end to help me reach the result I did. More than just the common app and essays, I submitted a number of supplemental materials, including the constructed language extended essay, the video profile, a couple music-related supplements, and finally my LOCI. My AO told me that they usually offer a post-gap-year enrollment to about 20-40 students per year, meaning that the statistical probability of getting the result I did was likely <0.1%. This was truly a miracle to me, and while I was already blessed to have gotten into Cornell and Vassar, my acceptance to UChicago was a dream come true.\n\nThough a gap year was never a part of my plan, I've come to realize that it too was a blessing. Over the  past year I've developed some significant mental and physical health complications, and a gap year provides me with enough time to heal. Furthermore, with AP-heavy courseloads the past two-years, I've had barely any free time to spend on artistic pursuits, at least outside of orchestra, and the gap year gives me a chance to do this as well! Once I heal, I'm hoping to travel, reconnect with my culture, and pursue internships. Though I never intended on taking this path, I now have a whole year to explore and to craft an experience for myself that I'd never have gotten to had I not gotten this opportunity. The future looks bright! \\^\\^\\*\n\nTo any rising seniors reading this, please know that even if things look bleak in the beginning, that things do get better. Trust the process, because it will take you to where you need to be, and things will work out in the end as long as you have patience and put in your best work. Best of luck to everyone!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/o5afv6/asian_american_shotgunner_gets_a_miracle_at_the/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/o5afv6/asian_american_shotgunner_gets_a_miracle_at_the/", "upvotes": 151, "num_comments": 37, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|SocSci", "query_matched": "2025 results"}

Everyone has the stats - find what makes you stand out. I admit, I didn’t know what the hell that was until a day or two before my first deadline, and that’s okay.

Founder and Head of Model UN Club, took up nearly all of my time in school (outside of class of course)\n\n2. Co-founder of International Relations and Global Affairs Club, and pivoted activities towards social outreach and education about global politics in my school, which was until then, non existent in the curriculum.\n\n3. Economics Research, basically just financial mathematics, statistical analysis and researching the global economy.\n\n4. Sociology Research, where I did a comparative study on interactions between religions, communal violence and it's larger interplay in international policy in both India and the US.\n\n5. Global Affairs research, where I basically studied the US's policies about overseas taxation and bigger army diplomacy.\n\n6. History Research, mainly a comparative study of Imperial Britain, Colonial India, and slavery in the US during the Victorian era, and ideas of liberty in each.\n\n7. Writing. Just something I adored. 60+ short poems and short stories, and published this as a book during my gap year (literally just 7 people bought it though lol)\n\n8. Piano. \n\n9. Gardening! I grew nearly a 100 species of plants in my lifetime and adore my plants! I really plan on getting rich in BigLaw and buy a house where I can have a small greenhouse lol (I actually said that in my Harvard interview lol)\n\n10. Volunteering at a local temple and the surrounding ashram in the mountains. Took up my weekends, but was really fulfilling and I talked about it in my personal statement.\n\n\n\n**Awards/Honors:**\nNothing really significant at all, I just put several school debate and MUN chair awards on here (nothing significant lol), AP Scholar and another pretty insignificant cash prize thing.\n\n\n**Letters of Recommendation:**\n\n* **Psychology (10/10):** Really spoke to my engagements in Psychology research both inside and outside the classroom, and was a real support for me during my mental health struggles.\n* **Economics (10/10):** Spoke to my quantitative and calculative abilities in Macroeconomics and Econometrics (this was an extremely important part of the letter because it helped address my Math gap properly.\n* **Counselor (10/10):** Loved this letter, spoke to my involvement with the debate, MUNs and my passion about Global Affairs.\n* **Research mentor (10/10):** She really helped me understand a lot of topics in IR and was the person who inspired me to apply for Global Affairs instead of Economics.\n\n\n**Essays:**\n\nMy main essay was about my growth as an American citizen who came to India, and how I discovered my identity as a result (generic I know, but very uniquely written, trust me). \n\nSupps were also pretty unique and included both my intellectual and artsy sides. Some of the LACs were absolute HELL to write cuz they're so short. But in general, most of my supps elaborated on my love for history and global politics.\n\n\n\n**Interviews:**\n \n**Macalester (sign-up):** 10/10, cute little conversation about Mac and it's offerings.\n\n**Georgetown:** Honestly pretty meh, but the lady also majored in Global Affairs and was pretty honest—probably the person who helped me realize that Georgetown wasn't the place for me.\n\n**Princeton:** 6/10, pretty bad as there was a storm and the call kept dropping, but also a great conversation.\n\n**Harvard:** 10/10, the man was totally not who I was expecting to be a Harvard alumnus. In a T-shirt and shorts, whereas here I was in a suit lol. Ultimately, it was a really deep conversation about self exploration, growth and understanding which lasted about 2.5 hours. Probably one of the deepest conversations I've had in my life.\n\n\n\n**Results:**\n\nAcceptances:\n\n1. Macalester College EA (13K EFC)\n2. Hamilton College RD (9K EFC)\n3. USC EA (43K EFC wtaf?)\n4. Lafayette College RD (12K EFC)\n5. Harvard College RD (7K EFC) ---> COMMITTED!!!! (And already graduated lol)\n\n\nWaitlists:\n\n1. Carleton College\n2. Pitzer College\n3. Bates College\n4. Washington University St. Louis\n5. University of Rochester\n6. Cornell\n7. Princeton??? (This was a complete surprise but who cares)\n\nRejections:\n\nAll the other ivies, Stanford, Duke, UChicago ED, Georgetown SFS (This was pretty disheartening), Swarthmore EDII, UVA, Amherst, Williams, Vanderbilt, Bowdoin, Grinnell, URichmond, Pomona, Middlebury, Emory, Haverford, Kenyon (yield protection?), Rice, Tufts (yield protection?), and Claremont McKenna.\n\n\nAdditional information:\n\n\nThe first time I applied during senior year of high school, I was ill-informed, lazy, did not do my research, and wrote pretty lousy essays. I had no AP tests to report, my SAT was the present equivalent of a 1460 (720R, 740M), and my academics were definitely sub-par for the very top schools, but somehow, Oberlin College accepted me to their Class of 2020 with an EFC of 9K. I was extremely grateful for it and I looked forward to matriculating, but somehow due to certain life events, I ended up taking a gap year.\n\n\nI understood the weaknesses that held me back in the first cycle I applied as I went along. More than my 10th board results (which basically have to be 95+ if you want ivies), my subjects in 11th and 12th were a really big problem because I did not have Mathematics. That's why nearly every place I applied to rejected me, except 2 waitlists (Hamilton and Macalester) and 1 acceptance (Oberlin).\n\nThe next cycle, I signed up for three AP exams, including 1 AP Calc which was the only way to demonstrate Math proficiency given my two year Math gap. That, and to score as high as possible on the SAT Math section. Given that I got a 4 and a 790, while not perfect, it demonstrated proficiency which was the most important thing.\n\nI reworked and refined my ECs, re-did my common app essay, and rewrote all my supp's. I was very strategic and applied to privates and only privates, and a shit ton of LACs because they were more likely to accept me (given what Oberlin did the previous year) and ignore my Math gap much more so than the ivies.\n\nUltimately, Macalester was my first acceptance after the devastating UChicago ED rejection (which was pretty reasonable given my whole Math fiasco and they're a Math heavy school). I nearly committed to Mac lol! I was that happy.\n\nBut I continued onto RD, and waited for interviews, of which I got only three: Georgetown, Princeton and Harvard. No Yale interview was pretty much torture, and the Georgetown rejection basically killed me, but I was relieved to get the Hamilton acceptance. Ultimately, I was prepared for full rejections at the ivies, and on ivy day, I literally had my Dad's credit card out to pay the $500 deposit on Hamilton's portal because I was so sure of the rejections. Each rejection stung, but the first surprise was Cornell's waitlist. Then Princeton's??? Harvard was the last decision I opened, and I nearly had a heart attack when I saw a red banner and \"Congratulations!\" I literally committed on the spot.\n\n\nI couldn't believe it. A college that had only accepted PCM (Physics, Chemistry, Math stream) students for as long as I could remember, but they took a Humanities student without Math. Sometimes, dreams really do come true. \n\n\nFast forward, from Fall '17 to Spring 2022 (took a gap year in between because of COVID-19), probably the best four years of my life. Sometimes, I would literally stand in Harvard quad for hours in disbelief at the sheer magnitude of where I was attending college. It was just that incredible to me — little o me, a guy from the middle of nowhere in Vermont, now in Shimla, at THE HARVARD???\n\nI ended up taking a gap year after I graduated, and am now at Harvard Law School's Class of 2026. (My gap year activities probably played a role in my HLS acceptance too)\n\n\nMoral of the story: **Take gap years!** They can be a **game changer** if you are strategic!\n\n\nIt has been an incredible, wild, wonderful, cathartic,  humbling, and honestly, magical journey. I resented my parents so much for bringing me to India, and me needing aid, having a worse chance at literally every school. But as I rewrote my common app essay, I really could feel nothing but overwhelming gratitude as to where I came from and, as I write this post now, where I am today.\n\n\n\nBest wishes to the incoming class of 2029. \n\nIt all works out in the end—trust me.

I think he knows me pretty well-ish though.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n*Princeton:* 4/10; pretty mediocre; struggled to answer some questions; connected a bit with music.\n\nNo one else wanted to interview me :(\n\n**Essays**\n\nPersonal statement was about using concepts I had learned in jazz band (creativity, complexity, soloing) in order to improve a game I played with my friends (nitroball, if anyone has heard of it). My English teacher really liked it. He said it was one of the best essays he had read (like top 5 or smth).\n\nSupplementals were varied. Brown was the best: I locked in on them and got pretty personal as well. I thought my essays for the other schools were decent. Princeton was definitely the worst though...

All of the essay writing killed me. I spent a good chunk of time on a cruise over winter break writing essays... Looking back, I definitely procrastinated too much on the application process, but I guess it all worked out. I have to say that I grew a lot as a writer and as a person during this time. There was a lot of soul searching and introspection during the entire process.\n\nAnother thing, it's kinda crazy seeing how many schools other people apply to. I understand the shotgun strategy, but quality is more important than quantity is it not? I guess if you start early enough it doesn't really matter, but I don't think you should be *that* concerned about college.

He talked about my intellectual curiosity and said I was one of the best students he's taught. \n\nCounselor (?/10) - I'm not sure about this one since I never read it, and I think this could be the reason for my results (idk though). My counselor changed a LOT throughout high school, so I was never really close to the one who ended up writing my rec letter. She knew about my research since I applied to STS, but other than that, she didn't know much.

He was straight out of undergrad so it was pretty easy to connect with him. I think I did alright in answering his questions.\n\nPrinceton (7.5/;10) - We had a very lengthy conversation (1.5-2 hrs i think) where we talked a lot about our background and experiences. He wasn't a STEM major so it was a little hard to explain my research, but he understood the implications of it and seemed to like my intellectual curiosity.\n\n**Essays**\n\nI worked with a private college advisor to write all of my essays and he helped me create a really good narrative to explain my research and my passions.  \n  \nCommon App (8.5/10) - Wrote about how my close family member died of a neurological disorder related to pesticides in rural asia and how it led me to pursue research to try and find a cure for it. Ended with my long-term goals for this issue.\n\nSupps (8/10) - Why us essay was a continuation of CA essay but with specific steps / resources at the uni I would use to pursue my goal. Wrote another essay about how/ why I started STEM advocacy and the non-profit and how I'd love to continue it at the university through whatever similar program they had.

Too bad I’m graduating now :P)\n- PROFILE: first gen/single mother household with two other siblings.\n\n\nSTATS:\n\n- GPA (UW/W): 3.28/3.54 \n- SAT: 1400 \n- Courses: 2 APs and 9 honors total\n- Grade trend:\nStarted freshman year with all A’s from freshman to Sophomore year. Had two D+’s (one in APUSH, other in SAT Prep) and two C’s in my junior year. Currently duking it out in all A’s for Senior year (AP Chinese, Honors precalc, honors Env. sci, honors world lit, etc.) \n\nCIRCUMSTANCES FOR MY DIP IN GRADES:\n\n- I got bad medical advice from my previous doctor and I was led to make some bad health choices that gave me fatigue, inattention, muscle weakness, and low energy levels. It really messed me up in Junior year. I got a new doctor now which is why I am doing better. \n\nMAJOR/INTERESTS:\n\nApplied as a Chemistry major for most schools, some as Chemical Engineering. My interests lie in improving the energy technology such as fuel cells, batteries, and solar cells. I particularly have heavy interest in their materials.\n\n\nActivities:\n\n1.) Baking Business (10th-11th)\n\nRan my own small baking business with my homemade sweets. I raised a total of $1000 starting very late from Sophomore year to end of Junior year (so like one year total becuase I operated during school days). I also outreached to other business entities like local deli shops and successfully sold my products for resale. \n\n2.) Translator/ “American Ambassador” (11th, summer)\n\nI was a translator/“american ambassador” or just group leader for a 5-day program held by the International Partnership of Education Research and Communication. My job was to help my own group of foreign Chinese middle school students who were part of the exchange program in projects, class work, activities, and made friends. For clarification, I am not part Chinese whatsoever. This really put my Chinese skills to the test.\n\n3.) Scriptwriter/Director (independent project) (11th)\n\nI was a scriptwriter and director for my own independent play that I made and collaborated with multiple voice actors (nine) to make it come to life.\n\n4.) Presentation (independent project, 12th)\n\nMade a presentation on oil chemistry and its effects, and held an audience of 30+ peers.\n\n5.) Pre-college Rice University Program (academic) (summer of 11th)\n\nSelf-explanatory activity. I did it under Anatomy and Physiology.\n\n6.) Poll Worker (work) (12th)\n\nI snagged this job as a senior. I helped as a poll worker for my local election district during the presidential election. Got paid $300. \n\n7.) Club Member (Club, 10th-11th)\n\nI was club member of my school’s interact club. I was a proactive member and snagged every opportunity I could get. Ranged from helping at food drives, to leading a small team during a color guard event. I enjoyed it and I accumulated over 80 hours of community service. \n\n\nLORS/ESSAYS:\n\n- Chinese teacher (8/10) knew them very well \n- counselor (7/10) said that they loved my activities but they took my stuff from naviance template so…\n- 10th grade English Teacher (8/10) I knew them very well too and they respected me a lot as a great student. They were also a teacher I respected a lot too.\n- Anatomy & Physiology Teacher (7/10) I also knew them well and we had great respect for each other. Counselor told me their letter was lovely.\n\n- Personal Essay (6.5): I struggle with self-reflection but the final product was enough to submit. \n\n- supplemental essays (8/10): I could actually answer the prompts and I loved the essays that I wrote. \n\n- If anyone wonders why I couldn’t get a teacher related to my major for LOR, I tried my chem teacher but they left and I couldn’t reach out to them. I’m doing physics right now because I took anatomy and physiology last year and I couldn’t take more than one science class at the time.\n\n\n\nAPPLIED TO:\n\n- Princeton \n- Yale\n- Columbia \n- Northwestern\n- NYU\n- Syracuse U\n- Rutgers (Newark and NB)\n- Rice\n- University of Rochester\n- Boston U\n- Rowan U\n- Seton Hall \n- NJIT\n- Montclair State\n- Stevens Institute of Technology \n\n\nRESULTS:\n\nRejected:\n\n- Princeton \n- Yale\n- Columbia \n- Northwestern\n- NYU (applied ED II)\n- Syracuse U\n- Rice\n- Boston U\n- University of Rochester\n\n\nAccepted:\n\n- Rutgers (Newark and NB) (federal aid covers it)\n- Rowan U ($7.5k scholarship/year)\n- Seton Hall ($34k scholarship/year)\n- NJIT (no aid :( but I can still afford with federal aid)\n- Montclair State ($7.5k scholarship/year)\n- Stevens Institute of Technology (waitlisted —> Accepted w/$34k scholarship/year) COMMITTED\n\n\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION:\n\nMy dip in my grades was attributed to the fact that I was given bad medical advice from my doctor. It led to some bad choices that gave me inattention, fatigue, and low energy levels. After changing doctors, I’ve been better, and now I’m back on track on performance (my teachers have also been giving me praise too which is nice). I expected most of my rejections, but when the NYU rejection came, I felt sadness, something I’m very unfamiliar with as it came from a college decision. I truly was not expecting to come off the waitlist for Stevens. I was already readying myself to commit to NJIT but when I saw the acceptance letter, I could not stop smiling! I’m committing to Stevens which is awesome for me! I can afford it since I can do without housing. Leaving me with $7k to pay. I do not mind staying at Stevens and I’m very grateful to have been accepted!

I am 26, located in Alabama and a former home schooled kid whose education was neglected. Basically I didn’t receive an education past the 3rd grade, so naturally I didn’t graduate high school or have transcripts or a diploma that I could use to apply to college.\n\nNow it’s always been my dream to attend college to gain knowledge and life experiences in order to give myself better opportunities in life than my current circumstances allow.\n\nI always knew I would have to take the GED in order to do that, but I’ve always had reservations about it. To be honest it’s just I’m ashamed that it would have to be that instead of an actual high school diploma. But I recently learned about online adult high school programs for those 21+ that would give you an actual high school diploma and transcripts that you could apply to a 4-year college with. My concern is that it’s a too-good-to-be-true scenario. Since I don’t see a lot information about these places outside of their websites and a few scattered mentions on Reddit and other sites. \n\nThe programs I’m looking at primarily are James Madison online adult high school and Excel high school for adults. The former seems more reputable than the later. Both say you can take classes online and earn actual credits towards a diploma and they would give you a gpa and transcripts. But I haven’t found much information on if they are legit or just diploma mills that aren’t valid for higher education. I have thought to contact the admissions offices of the various universities I’m interested in, but I haven’t had the nerve to open myself up to a potentially embarrassing phone call with an admissions officer.\n\nI’m aware it’s far more common to just take the GED, go to community college to build up your gpa and transfer to 4 year college. But it’s important to me to say I have an actual high school diploma and to spend all 4 years at the same school. Now if that isn’t likely or even possible then I’ll accept that and do the GED, but if there’s a chance then I have to take that too.\n\nMy plan is to major in biology, as my career interests are in botany and zoology. I’m hoping to work towards a career in either the U.S. Forestry service/national park system or work as a zoologist in a zoo or wildlife refuge/sanctuary.\n\nI truly do appreciate any help and advice you can provide on this topic.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1nrv4rn/ged_vs_adult_high_school_diploma_for_attending/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1nrv4rn/ged_vs_adult_high_school_diploma_for_attending/", "upvotes": 4, "num_comments": 2, "flair": "Other|Other|Other", "query_matched": "chance me"}

Only after my rejections did I spend the time to reflect on myself and what I wanted, and I realized that economics was not what I truly wanted to do. The \"investment banking\" dream that I had in mind was not a life that I would be happy and feel fulfilled living. After finding out at UCSD that there were a plethora of majors that I could switch to without any problems, I ended up switching into \"bioinformatics\", a major that fascinates me and that UCSD is world-renowned for. I can't vouch for everyone, but in my case, rejection is truly redirection.\n\nAlso, one thing that I tried to make clear in my college apps was that I wasn't really playing the \"college game\" (though in 12th grade, I realized that I had to do these activities to maximize my chances at my dream school). In fact, rather than writing a very quirky and unique essay like you are supposed to, I wrote about my passionate pursuit of my sport in my personal statement, and this clearly wasn't the right move. My point is that everyone tells you to be authentic in your college apps, as your \"true self\" will shine through, but this is rarely the case. Build that club that sounds impressive, do that research internship that you're not passionate about. College apps don't reward the honest and the authentic; they reward people who play the \"college game.\"", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1kktd81/getting_rejected_by_dream_school_was_the_best/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1kktd81/getting_rejected_by_dream_school_was_the_best/", "upvotes": 55, "num_comments": 13, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|Art/Hum", "query_matched": "chance me"}

Essays were defo worse quality here than everywhere else, just generally lacking a distinctive voice (because I sent REA. learnt lessons from this that I used everywhere else)\n* Yale (8/10): Mannn I liked these essays but I guess they didn't really stand out too much... pro tip, just referencing res colleges at Yale and talking about being a Trumbullian and joining the Tyng cup may not be enough.\n* Columbia (9/10): Honestly I was pretty shocked when I saw I didn't get into Columbia... I know I shouldn't be surprised when it comes to not getting into any of these schls but it did surprise me a little because I thought these were ON POINT. I loved my \"why Columbia\" and struggle essays - it made me bring out a more vulnerable side of myself.\n* Cornell (9/10): Okay come on Cornell these were fire. I applied for Dyson with a second choice of the Hotel School so both must've read my app and said no but I really did go all out here, esp. since the Dyson essay is so damn long\n* Brown (8/10): Can't lie, these were good but not exceptional\n* UPenn (8/10): Applied for the Huntsman program for international management with the hook of trying to be a \"liason between American corporations and the Indian growth story\" or something like that since I'm an Indian who's spent his life abroad\n* Stanford (7/10): Okay imma be real here, by the time I worked on Stanford I was kinda scared and applied for STS instead of Econ hoping that it would help my chances, but I do NOT RECOMMEND this strategy since it certainly weakened my essays because i kinda didn't know wth I was talking about.\n* UCs (9/10): Okay these essays were really damn good. If I can't submit my SAT then you best believe I'm bringing my A-game to the essays\n* UChicago (10/10): Okay my Chicago essays were actually lowk booker prize worthy.\n   * The first quirky pick your own prompt one, I wrote to the prompt that's like \"pac man has 3 lives, elements have 1/2 lives, pick something and explain why it has as many lives as it does,\" and I wrote a whole philosophical exposition about the hardcore YOLO mode in call of duty infinite warfare and how Nick Reyes's mortality brings his life value, and how that extends to the human experience.\n   * The other one about why UChi was also insane, i did everything that's usually in a why uni essay, like talking about cool courses, programs, etc. except I did it in a really cool and imagery infused day in the life format.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* >!UChicago!!!! came in clutch for me fr, got waitlisted at first but I'M IN NOW, GO MAROONS!<\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* UChicago\n* UC Berkeley\n* UCLA\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Harvard\n* Princeton\n* Yale\n* Columbia\n* Cornell\n* Brown\n* UPenn\n* Stanford\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n*So yeah. That was my college application experience. Pretty wild imo... my parents were pulling their hair out the day before Ivy day, and I get it. I was pretty tense too, but I've always been a (calculated? smart?) risk taker. And I won, but just by a whisker.*\n\n*I mean... when I think about it, it's hard to even believe. In the end, I got into UChicago, for RD, as an international. That would put my odds at around \\~2%. And then think about me being an Indian male trying to major in econ. It's pretty shocking imo. It's the school I actually had the least faith in... lowk thought I had a better shot at Harvard since I missed ED1 and ED2 for UChi. But yeah, luck played out in my favor: I've got family in Chicago, and I actually love the school's vibe, class size, everything :).*\n\nBut wait up, getting into Chi wasn't that clear cut... I got waitlisted first. And I think the only reason I got in was a REALLY good LOCI. I sent it out the same day I got WL, and it was very bold. I didn't mention myself or my achievements or my growth. Rather, I nerded out about the history of chicago as a city, and then invited the AO to portillo's with me. And it worked.\n\nSo here's my takeaway: I applied to 13 schools. Every application I made, I got more and more genuine. I became realer and realer. Sometimes I still felt like finessing the system a little like I tried with Stanford STS instead of Econ, but life taught me that that isn't the way. Chicago was my most genuine app, and when I read it, I know that is me, distilled into a few hundred words. I'm proud of my journey, and more so of how it's made me look into myself and understand myself. Finally, I'm happy that every other school rejected or waitlisted me. It humbled my stupid often narcissistic self and taught me to appreciate what I have and what I earn, and that nothing is entitled to me even if the numbers would suggest so.\n\nThanks everybody out here on Reddit, a lot of your insights did help me out when I was looking into colleges, and if anybody's got any questions for me, I'll take em so lay them on.\n\nPS: I did get into Bocconi and the Stockholm School of Economics too like I mentioned in the intro... I guess my gut was right after all. Didn't talk about them much since you kinda just apply and that's it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1ker93j/indian_international_student_applies_only_reaches/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1ker93j/indian_international_student_applies_only_reaches/", "upvotes": 71, "num_comments": 18, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|SocSci", "query_matched": "chance me"}

Youngest paid coach in the club (to my knowledge), earned my USSF D Coaching License during this time.*\n2. Math Club/Team: Competed in various math competitions, never won anything big, but had decent contributions to the team. Served as an assistant for all of high school, teaching a class of 30+ students competition strategies twice a week (taught about 70+ kids total). Qualified for a few lower tier national math competitions.\n3. Summer Research: Did research under the guidance of a professor from a local university, studied the use of origami modeling to design structures for impact mitigation, learned a bit of solidworks.\n4. Marching Band: It was marching band\n5. Student Council: Served as the president of my grade for two years, implemented fundraisers and raffles, spearheaded a peer to peer support group system.\n6.

Competitive soccer leadership award (twice)\n3. Junior Marshall (top 9 gpas)\n4. Honorable Mention at a national math competition, qualified all years in high school\n5. Service award from school\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nMath Team Coach and Former Teacher: 10/10, Had a very strong bond with him, was one of the only adults I trusted to come out to, have worked with him since 5th grade, served as one of his assistant's from 9th grade onwards. Still keep in touch with him until this day.\n\nResearch Professor: 8/10, I think he wrote a decent letter, he liked my work, but I did not get to finish it because he left for another university.\n\nCoaching Boss: 9/10, He was the one who took a chance on me and allowed me to be a competitive coach after being allowed by him to volunteer for a year in the competitive program. Told me that he liked my work ethic and my promotion to being a paid coach was well deserved. Seemed disappointed that I wasn't staying in NC.\n\nHighschool History Teacher: 7/10, Did well in his class and talked to him all throughout high school.\n\nPhysics Teacher: 6.5/10, Probably wrote a standard letter of rec, nothing special.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nI came into my two interviews very unprepared (MIT and NU). They both went poorly but it seems to not have made a large impact on decisions.\n\n**Essays**\n\nMy common app essay focused on how coaching saved my soul, changed how I viewed the world, and how I want to use it as an outlet to help the children I coach improve as people first, then as players. It was good writing but I felt that it could have been more efficient in its delivery. I would classify it as personal growth.\n\nI think my supplemental essays for Northwestern were my best writing through the application process. I think they summed me up very well in just a few hundred words.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* UNCA, EA\n* NC State, EA + Park Scholarship Semifinalist\n* Northwestern, ED\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* \n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* We will never know\n\n**Additional Info**\n\nI fully believe that I got really lucky to get in to NU with my extracurriculars comparative to a lot of other people. DEI probably did help and my essays must have done much of the heavy lifting compared to my extracurriculars.

She was one of my favorite teachers I had at my time in HS.\n\nChemistry Teacher (8/10) - Again, also had a good relationship with the teacher. Might actually have a good LOR since the chemistry department isn't really well-liked at my school, so having a student actually like chemistry and the chemistry teachers might be new (yeah idk lol, again just vibes, but I really had a good relationship with this teacher)\n\n**Interviews**\n\nLafayette (8/10) - Felt pretty good; Talked about my interest in the environment & history; said it was sad that the interview was only limited to 30 min. (College policy with interviews)\n\nLehigh (9/10) - One of my favorites; talked about my interest in the environment and being premed (with my father and all). Also talked about a potential research project idea I had for my senior year (I didn't end up doing it because of stress oof) that was essentially about gaming and psychology\n\nHaverford (6/10) - Honestly, it felt like the interviewer wasn't really vibing, so it was alright.\n\nSwarthmore (9/10) - My favorite interview; talked about my interest in history, politics, & the environment and connected it with law (the interviewer was a lawyer)\n\nUPenn (7.5/10) - It was alright. Though, we did connect over my interest in medicine, especially when I talked about my anatomy teacher having giant posters depicting cell signaling pathways for cancer in the classroom\n\nPrinceton (7/10) - It was alright. Nothing much else to say.\n\n**Essays**\n\nI feel like essays were what got me into my two T20 acceptances since (IN MY OPINION) I have very okay/mid-level ECs.\n\nPersonal Statement - I talked about the idea of \"creation\" and \"destruction\" in my life through three prongs - computer science (yeah Idk where I was going with that), the environment (common theme if you couldn't tell) and my involvement with it, and medicine (yeah my father, + my grandmom having had breast cancer + family history of diabetes/other conditions on both sides) and how I would learn about the world through this lens. Coding could be used for good (e.g., making crucial applications) and bad (cyber attacks). The Earth is a beauitful world that exists nowhere else, but humanity has been destroying it. The human body is a complex machine that amazes me but diseases like kidney disease break it down, so doctors and other healthcare professionals act as \"mechanics\" to fix it.\n\n  \nOther Essays \n\nI talked a lot about my interest in the environment. For example, I talked about how I used my knowledge from Envirothon to come up with solutions tackling fictional situations concerning environmental problems from the competition. I used such knowledge during a mock debate in front of about 200 students for AP Gov  to talk about sustainable solutions if I were Pres. of the U.S. I also talked about my interest in medicine and the such.\n\nMy favorite essays though might be the Northwestern ones. I talked about how I would paint an image on the Rock (google it) symbolizing humanity's struggle to obtain understanding the vast universe while also suffering because of humans being humans. In another essay, I proposed a class where we compared events in anime to real world history. \n\n**Decisions** \n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Colorado College \n* Drexel University (EA)\n* Duquesne University\n* Lafayette College \n* Lehigh University\n* Moravian University (EA)\n* Muhlenberg College (EA)\n* Northwestern University \n* University of Notre Dame\n* University of Pittsburgh\n* Villanova University (EA)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Amherst College\n* Boston University\n* Case Western Reserve University\n* College of the Holy Cross\n* Columbia University\n* Emory University\n* Haverford College\n* Pomona College\n* Rice University\n* Skidmore College\n* Swarthmore College\n* Wake Forest University\n* WashU in St. Louis\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Brown University\n* Cornell University\n* Duke University\n* Johns Hopkins University\n* New York University\n* Northeastern University (Deferred EA)\n* Princeton University\n* Tufts University \n* University of Chicago (Deferred EA)\n* University of Pennsylvania (Deferred ED - this one hurt a lot)\n* University of Southern California\n* Vanderbilt University\n* Yale University\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI really thought I had no chance at T20s this year because of how competitive the cycle would be (and ended up being) and because I felt my ECs were VERY mid (like your typical club stuff, no initiatives, nonprofits, projects, huge competitions like USAMO, etc.).

I average like a 95 and presented research at a symposium. This year, I talk to him way more. Went to office hours a lot and constantly asks questions about bio. \n\nAP Physics C Mechanics and APES teacher (7/10): He said he highlighted the fact that I grew from junior year to senior year (junior year was rough) exponentially. I have a very good relationship with him. \n\nAlgebra 2 teacher (4-5/10): I barely know her. I  got an 100 in her class but I never talked sophomore year and only had a couple interactions with her. Honestly ran out of people to ask. \n\nGuidance Counselor (9-10/10): She knows me the most out of any faculty in my school. I talked to her throughout junior year a lot because of my mental health and she was a lot of help. She's seen me grow a lot in a year.\n\n**Essays**\n\nMy personal essay was about how my deep passion for space basically saved me from being alone by going to space camp and finding my people, ultimately creating new relationships that will forever resonate with me (I won't lie, I feel as though it's very basic but I got a Harvard grad to review it and they like it). \n\nSupplemental essays were rushed for most of the early RD deadline schools. All of the others that were due after or on Jan 1st were to me amazing. Got an english teacher to review them and she said she loved them.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n**All are RD unless indicated otherwise since I'm adding scholarships and stuff**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Rutgers NB \n* Penn Staw UP (costs in-state bc of military dependent status)\n* Denison University (15k/yr merit and 45k grant for 2025-2026 school yr)\n* NJIT (got in for applied physics. applied EA II)\n* Pitt \n* UofA Honors (13.5k/yr scholarship)\n* ASU Honors (17.5k/yr scholarship)\n* CU Boulder\n* Stony Brook (5k/yr scholarship)\n* MSU (in-state COA bc military dependency)\n\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* UMN (Def -> waitlisted) applied EA II\n* UofSc\n* WPI\n* Reed College\n* UCF \n\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Clemson\n* UMD\n* UW Madison\n* OSU\n* UNC (reaches of all reaches)\n* Wesleyan \n* Oberlin College \n* NC State \n* UIUC \n\n\nNot gonna lie I totally understand my rejections but UMN waitlist is crazy. I just wanna throw it out there but I hate how I have to clutch my grades in the one yesr that is seen as the least important for college apps. Like I got a 4.57 W GPA first semester and I wish I committed myself way earlier. I' m  having a hard time being happy lol. I know a lot of high school kids say this but I had a lot of mental health issues that would not be good to put on common app so they just think I was either lazy or stupid junior year (for reference I had a 2.92 W GPA junior year). My guidance counselor recommended me a place for therapy but like most males today I didn't think I needed it. I still do think I didn't need it because in the end I found myself but it's unfortunate that it had to take a while. Honsetly surpirsed I got into Rutgers, Penn State UP, but especially Denison. I really wish I did good enough for merit at CU Boulder bc that's my favorite school and best for my major(s) but unfortunately not. 72/year and needing to go to grad school does not mix well. To me, Rutgers is expensive, like 32.4/year is soooo much. My parents say it's fine but I can't help but feel guilty for it though. The fact that it's my cheapest school is crazy though, like why can't a school be under 30k 😭 \n\n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jq72sd/avg_student_disappointed_by_results_but/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jq72sd/avg_student_disappointed_by_results_but/", "upvotes": 20, "num_comments": 3, "flair": "3.4+|1200+/25+|STEM", "query_matched": "chance me"}

Reading all of these posts and stories made me wonder how on earth I got into where I did a decade ago. I was an oddball personality student that slacked upwards to success in class and only really gave 100% effort in my main EC (debate).\n\n**Demographics**\n\n* Gender: Male\n* Race/Ethnicity: Asian (Indian)\n* Residence: Texas\n* Income Bracket: Upper middle class\n* Type of School: Very large public (well regarded in-state, 1/3rd of our graduating class ended up at UT Austin or Texas A&M)\n* Hooks (Recruited Athlete, URM, First-Gen, Geographic, Legacy, etc.): None\n\n**Intended Major(s)**: Economics and Statistics. I figured this out thanks to my sophomore-year AP Stats teacher who made a big impact on me and I kept in touch with in college.\n\n**Academics**\n\n* GPA (UW/W): 4.0/don't remember weighted \\[my school had this weird system where they just tacked on a multiplier if you took an honors or AP course\\]\n* Rank (or percentile): 42/\\~700 \\[at the time, this was good enough for auto-admission to UT Austin\\]\n* \\# of Honors/AP/IB/Dual Enrollment/etc.: 7 honors, 17 AP courses\n* Senior Year Course Load: AP Physics C, AP Human Geography, AP Art History, AP Macroeconomics (1 semester), AP Government (1 semester), AP English Lit, Debate\n   * Special math course that our school arranged at the last minute for 30 of us since the district required everyone to take a math course every year and they didn't have a course after AP Calculus BC previously.\n\n**Standardized Testing**\n\n* SAT I: 2280/2400 (single test, don't remember splits)\n* ACT: 32 (this was offered randomly in-school one day)\n* SAT II: Math II (750), World History (740)\n* AP/IB: Art History (5), Calculus AB (5), Calculus BC (5), Chemistry (4), Computer Science (5), English Language (5), English Literature (5), Government (5), Human Geography (5), Macroeconomics (5), Physics 1 (5), Physics 2 (3), Physics C: Mechanics (4), Physics C: E&M (3), Statistics (5), US History (5), World History (5)\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\n\n1. Speech and Debate Team Captain - I spent way too many hours preparing and arguing random topics. At one point I was solo coaching my event team (LD) and 8 novices because our debate program director knew nothing about debate and was phoning it in for an extra stipend on his paycheck. 3x state qualifier in multiple events, modest state and national level success. I got a sports letterman jacket for it too.\n2. Model UN - I participated on the club team but I wasn't good at it. It was fun though.\n3. Tennis - I played on the school freshman team since I had played since I was 5. However, the team head coach at the time basically told me I was blocked from advancing further because of my physical build (not lean enough, too much power), so I quit the school team and just played USTA junior tournaments for the rest of high school.\n4. Volunteering - Every week I volunteered at the local library and at a homeless shelter. It was worth it in my opinion if only because it helped shape my worldview which has served me well.\n5. UIL Academics - This is a series of academic competitions organized by the Texas state government that any public school can compete in. I was asked to compete in a math competition (Number Sense) and LD debate. I got out of districts once and to regionals for debate but that was it.\n6. National Honor Society - I was inducted at the end of Sophomore year and remained in good standing all the way until graduation....when I forgot about the last requirement so I didn't get a special graduation stole.\n7. Biotech Lab Intern/HS Research Program - One summer I did guided biotech research as part of a local university program for high schoolers. Another summer I spent a few hours per day growing cell cultures and creating cell culture media for a biotech lab at that same local university.\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n1. AP Scholar (distinction)\n2. National Merit Commended Scholar\n3. I had some kind of small honor from the National Speech and Debate Association\n4. Mu Alpha Theta\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nAP Stats Teacher - 10/10, probably my best letter and the person I had the best relationship with. I would not be doing what I do today if not for her.\n\nAP US History Teacher - 9/10, second best letter, I always talked in her class (and would often be the only one), even though sometimes I agitated with contrarian views of history (which got me into arguments with the two people who sat next to me - one of which unironically believed that we should return to the control of the British monarchy, and another who supported neo Nazi thinking....). She appreciated my persistence and determination to push the class beyond.\n\nAP Human Geography/World History teacher - 6/10 - This was probably my weakest letter IMO and it was honestly redundant given my US History teacher's letter.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nNorthwestern (interview since abolished) - This was not great because I had no idea what to expect since this was my first interview and online interview resources were way less available back then. I also didn't have anyone in my life or family that had done college interviews before. I talked to the female alum for about 30 minutes, I was nervous AF, and I ran away as quickly as possible.\n\nUT Business Honors (also since abolished) - Awful interview because it happened unscheduled without any warning. I was chilling at home on a couch watching football with my dad when our home phone rang. Turns out the caller was from the Business Honors program and he interviewed me on the spot for admission. Naturally I didn't do the best.\n\nUChicago (also since abolished) - I got used to interviewing by this point and this one felt really casual at a nice coffee shop in town. We had a good conversation, the female alum went out of her way to make me feel comfortable and I felt great about it.\n\nColumbia (also since abolished) - Unremarkable honestly. I have zero memory of what me and the male alum talked about outside of the Wall Street Journal.\n\nUPenn - This one I remember the most because it came up that I was LGBT and so was the male alum (based on his LinkedIn) and it felt validating that an adult accepted who I was (I was still in the closet to friends and family).\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon app + supplements: 8/10. All I remember is that I talked about the big personal interest I had at the time (trash reuse and waste reduction), how I implemented it in my life, and a biotech idea I had for an innovation in composting technology. This was a pain to write because I wasn't confident and got peer feedback that was negative for months. \\[And in hindsight this made no sense with what I wanted to study\\]\n\nUT: 9/10. It was two long essays. In one I had to talk about the environment I was raised in and how it shaped me as a person (I talked about my religion) and in another I reworked my common app essay about trash to frame it as an interest I had.\n\nUC system: 10/10. I was most proud of these because I could just speak from the heart. It was two long essays. In one I had to talk about the world I came from and how it shaped my dreams/aspirations (again I talked about my religion), and in the other I talked about a personal quality, talent, accomplishment, contribution or experience I had (I talked about my experience in speech and debate).\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\nI applied only to out of state and dream schools knowing that I had UT Austin automatically clinched as a good option if everything went wrong.\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* ***UC Berkeley (graduated 2020)***\n* Michigan\n* UT Austin (automatic admission, would have been unspecified Business at McCombs)\n* UCLA\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* NYU (they held me on a waitlist until mid-July --> fun fact, I didn't realize until later that NYU has no statistics department)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* UT Austin Business Honors\n* UPenn\n* UChicago (ED deferred -> rejected)\n* Columbia\n* Northwestern\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nY'all seem to have it rough out there with higher admission standards, higher costs, and a need to overperform in all facets. If I applied today, I feel like I would be in a rough spot and end up at a lesser regarded college. My resume was basically good grades, good test scores and debate.\n\nI would also not have automatic admission at UT Austin to fall back on (since I would miss the top 6% cutoff rule on a rounding error, and next year it's being lowered to top 5%).\n\nI kind of expected these results. The private schools seemed like a parallel inaccessible universe to me, except for UChicago where I thought I had a chance given my interview.\n\nI was legitimately shocked to get into Berkeley, when I opened the email decision letter I screamed my head off for 20 minutes like a mad man. That place made me who I am today and I'm a better person and member of society for it.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jp703w/a_look_back_a_decade_later_2016_results/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jp703w/a_look_back_a_decade_later_2016_results/", "upvotes": 34, "num_comments": 6, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "chance me"}

Interviewer was very sweet and social, but we had different majors so there wasn’t much to discuss except for Princeton’s student body/culture. NO NEED TO BE NERVOUS FOR INTERVIEWS, they're just casual conversations. Under 30 minutes.\n\nBarnard: Zoom; probably a 6/10, was part of the CSTEP program.

Interviewer was kind of awkward, and I was too! Under the 30 minute mark.\n\n**Essays**\n\nQB: Wrote about healing my relationship with my mother, focusing on themes of combining culture with language/communication 9/10\n\nCommon App: Similar to QB, but shortened\n\nSupplements: I think all were pretty good! Mainly did them the day or two before. If I had to choose, Yale’s was my worst. \n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD):** Did QB Match, but did not Match in December! Missed all my EA/ED chances. So all are RDs. I also listed whether I used the CA or QB for each of them, for those who are curious. By the way future Questies, for some schools you can’t change your application from QB to CA, so be careful; and some schools allow you to edit your QB applications, others don't.\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Princeton - QB → Committed, Go Tigers!\n* UPenn - QB\n* Brown - QB\n* USC - CA\n* Barnard - CA\n* Vassar - QB\n* WashU - CA\n* Amherst - QB\n* Williams - QB\n* Bowdoin - QB\n* RPI - QB\n* SUNY UBuff, SUNY Bing, SUNY Stony Honors - CA\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* Duke - QB \n* Cornell - QB = Honestly, I submitted my application super late cause I thought I could use CA, but then Cornell emailed me to redo it on QB 💔\n* Northwestern - CA \n* Rice - CA\n* Vanderbilt  - QB\n* Tufts - CA\n* Emory  - QB\n* CWRU  - QB\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Stanford  - CA\n* MIT - QB\n* Yale  - QB\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nFor someone with weak ECs (in my opinion, compared to everyone on A2C or chance me, etc.) and started ECs mainly in 11th grade, I did NOT expect to get into any of the Ivies, especially Princeton, or the top LACs. But I guess all of those essays paid off somehow!\n\nTBH, I cried so hard after not getting matched and I hated my QB responses after being rejected from match. But, it all worked out at the end, and that’s all that matters :) \n\nLet me know if you need any help with QB in September/October, whenever it starts. Make sure to perfect your QB when you submit it in October as that would be the official copy sent to the schools, but you can always email the admissions office / upload updates/changes to your ECs/course load on the portal, which is what I did for a lot of schools. \n\n  \n", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jom6ul/unmatched_questie_gets_some_good_results/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jom6ul/unmatched_questie_gets_some_good_results/", "upvotes": 22, "num_comments": 1, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "chance me"}

If you really want to play your sport in college - DONT GIVE UP! there's always an opportunity somewhere and mine came from caltech. It's sort of a blessing in disguise that I was rejected because I've come to realize that I don't love the sport as much as I thought and taking some time off from ultra competitive baseball might be nice.

Had her in sophomore and junior year. She was a strict teacher, but I think she has good things to say about her students. She didn't even ask me for a resume so everything she wrote had to come from what she thought of me which was probably good things. I didn't know her too much though but this letter was likely the more unique out of the three. 7 or 8/10.\n\nCounselor.

While many start with dream schools in their preteens and early teen years, I didn’t give college a glancing thought until about April of my junior year. Even then, I doubted I could go to a top 20 school; my plan until August of last fall was to go to Idaho State University as a physics major and see what happened from there. But, by chance, I stumbled across the ApplyingToCollege Discord server, which saw my profile as one worthy of top schools and encouraged me to apply. I bit the bullet and chose an REA and a handful of RD schools, ending up adding more and more as I went.

Take it with a grain of salt.\n\n\n\nCollege admissions are pretty random ngl. Honestly, I wouldn’t be surprised if some schools used an RNG to decide between a few highly qualified candidates. Obviously there are parts of the process that aren’t random: if you are academically unqualified (say 1100 SAT/3.0 applying to T20’s), you will almost certainly be rejected and if you medaled at IMO or got a grand prize at ISEF, you will almost certainly be accepted. However, there are many qualified applicants who don’t fit cleanly into either category and distinguishing between them can be extremely difficult. So, schools generally use institutional priorities to make these distinctions. Institutional priorities vary between schools and change often. They are not something we have any control over or knowledge of. However, as application strength increases, the applicant will align with more \"institutional priorities\" and their chance of getting accepted increases. Schools aren't just looking for the best students. There are so many random factors at play that influence decision outcomes. Try not to worry about it and just focus on making your application as good as it can be. That's the best you can do. On that topic, DO NOT SLACK ON ESSAYS. When schools are trying to decide between applicants who are very similar on paper, essays are the first thing they turn to. It really sucks to see people who worked super hard for 4 years not get the results they wanted because they had low effort essays. Don't be that person. I'm not the best writer, but I spent a lot of time thinking about my essays and I came up with some interesting topics. I was also fortunate enough to have people (friends, parents, teachers, school counselor) who were willing to help me out. If you have people who could help with your essays, take advantage of it. Too many cooks in the kitchen is a bad thing, but try to find at least 3 people to help edit your essays (if you can; not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to, but take advantage of what you have -definitely do not spend 10k on private counseling). Once you craft the best application you can (try to make it something you are proud of), the only thing you can do is wait. If you're deferred or waitlisted, send in an LOCI and if you are offered an interview, take it. Although in my original post I said that interviews were basically to \"make sure you're not an asshole\" and that they don't matter beyond that, I don't think that's entirely true. They're not a particularly important part of the process, but they do matter a bit. I noticed that, between my friends and I, perceived interview strength did seem to be correlated to decision outcome (idk if its statistically significant at all; just some empirical stuff I thought it was worth mentioning). Just take the interview opportunity and try your best. Prepare for basic questions (like \"tell us about yourself\") and do your best to look presentable and show up on time. The interview is probably more important for some majors than others so especially if you're more of an academic candidate, dont stress it too much (math majors aren't accepted for their social skills, for example).\n\nOne thing I also think isn't talked about enough: I think that the best thing you can do is to differentiate yourself in some way. Have something unique about yourself or an interesting hobby, especially if you're a similar applicant to me. For me, those things were lifting and jiu-jitsu/mma. Lifting isn't a super uncommon activity, but the amount of effort I put into it definitely differentiated me (I did hit 320 on bench and get that school record btw). Honestly, I'd recommend the gym for anyone unless you have a physical condition that limits how much exercise you can do. It's a really great way to release energy and get a change of scenery. I think I would've gone insane if I just studied all day without getting out. MMA is less common, and competing regularly in Jiu-Jitsu and earning my blue belt was definitely a unique feature of my application. If you have a gym near you, try it out. It helped clear my head even more than lifting because it's very technical so you have to focus the entire time and there's little room left for other thoughts. The activities on your own don't do much for the application, but they make you unique and that could make a difference in your outcome. Although I think it's best for your application to have a clear direction (don't try to be the \"well rounded\" applicant who just has a random collection of EC's), you should try to have something to make your application multi-dimensional. \"Olympiad kids\" get stereotyped a lot as no personality losers who lock themselves in a room all day and study and having hobbies that are atypical for academics-oriented applicants definitely helped me dispel that notion. It was also just free essay content and stuff I could talk about in my interviews if they focused too much on one thing.\n\nNow here's something that took me a little too long to realize: Basically, your decision for school X and school Y are correlated, but they are independent events. Just because you get rejected/waitlisted at school X does not mean you will not get in to school Y. Obviously there are limits to this (like if you get rejected from your state school with >60% acceptance rate, your chances at MIT aren't all that great), but for each school you apply to, if you apply 100 times, there is a certain number that you will be accepted/waitlisted/rejected. What happens each time the process is run is random. You might get an AO who found a dead bug on his breakfast platter that morning. Random stuff happens. You never know. What happens at any individual school is random. If you have a 40% chance of getting accepted into a school (obviously don't try to estimate these percentages, but just know it is a game of chance), 3 out of 5 times, you'll get hit with a rejection. But, if you applied to a more prestigious school that you have a 10% chance of getting into, regardless of what happens, that figure is still 10%. I get it, this may hurt a bit and you may now think that your chance is only 5%. But the figure doesn't change regardless of how you're feeling. Yesterday, I found out early that I had not been accepted to Cornell through some portal astrology. I went ballistic and that ruined my day right up until I opened my Harvard letter. Not because I wanted to go to Cornell. I decided beforehand that Georgia Tech would be a better deal and that I'd go there even if accepted to Cornell. But my logic was something like \"if Cornell didn't accept me (legacy btw, forgot to put this in the original post), what chance do I have at Harvard, Yale or Princeton?\". So yeah, don't get too down about rejections and waitlists. If you have a good application and you apply to about 10 realistic reaches, your chance of getting into at least one isn't bad (assuming 10% probability of acceptance at each one, your chance of getting into at least one is about 2/3). And yk \"it only takes one\". But don't rely too heavily on individual school. Try your best to not have a dream school. Things are just too random to guarantee anything but as long as you apply to a good range of schools, you are very likely to get in somewhere that you are happy with (regardless of the outcome for that one school).\n\nAnyways, this was a crazy ride and I'm just glad it's over. I was honestly ready to commit to GT in February after I got that scholarship. I thought about it a lot and I was really happy with the prospect of going there, but I almost drove myself to insanity because I was so nervous that I'd have to commit there instead of another school. Crazy what this process can do to you.\n\n  \nThis is your friendly reminder: It ain't over 'til it's over. Keep pushing guys.

Indian Classical Music Tutor/Performer – I sang with a few famous Indian Classical Musicians when they came to visit my city. My singing is featured on their YouTube channel with \\~50k subscribers. I also tutored a few students in this music form.\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*\n\n1. Two top-10 finishes at FBLA Nationals (1 was first place and the other was 7th); both were in computer/data science-y events\n2. College Hackathons - Ranked 1/\\~650 in an international college hackathon; Won \\~5k prize; Ranked 3rd in a different state-wide college hackathon\n3. State Science Fair – 3^(rd) place in Computer Science Category, 4^(th) place in Computer Science Category in different years\n4. PennApps Invitation (Was accepted by PennApps, a UPenn Computer Science club, to their on-campus hackathon). As far as I know, my team and I were the only high schoolers there; everyone else seemed to be from colleges.\n5. State History Fair – National Qualifier in my category (awarded to top two entries per category per state)\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nCounselor: 7-8/10 – He knows and likes me. I’m in his office often and we have a relaxed rapport. His letter of recommendation emphasized that I was interested in the intersection of service and STEM.\n\nIB/AP Calc Math Teacher: 8/10 – He has had me for 3 years now (between AP and IB classes) and knows me well. His letter spent some time discussing concrete ways in which I have helped others in his class (for instance, holding AP Calc review sessions for other students).\n\nIB English Teacher: 8/10 – It’s worth noting that I consistently tend to score in the top 10% of students in her class on all important projects/assessments because this proves that she has found my writing to be of better quality than most other students. Her letter was similar to Math Teacher in that she has had me for multiple years and her letter detailed information about how I helped other students in her classes by clarifying classwork, reviewing essay, etc.\n\n \n\n**Interviews**\n\nPrinceton – 6/10. This was my first one; It was quick, and the conversation was surface level. Not terrible or anything; just not amazing.\n\nHarvard – 8/10. Connected well with interviewer, and she seemed interested in my extracurriculars (especially the Ugly Food Donation App – the fourth extracurricular)\n\nStanford – 8/10. Chill guy; we spent roe time talking about what I would want to do on campus at Stanford if I got in rather than the extracurriculars I had done in the past.\n\nRice – 9/10. I knew the guy’s son because he worked with me at the nonprofit. We spent a lot of time talking about socioeconomic equality in education.\n\nDuke – 6/10. By far the most intellectually stimulating conversation. My interviewer’s parents were sociologists, so we had plenty to talk about. However, the guy seemed like he was in a hurry (I think he was working, but idk really).\n\nYale – No interview; bad sign\n\nPenn – No interview; bad sign\n\nCornell – No interview; Cornell interviewed nobody form my region, as far as I know. However, I don’t think this was necessarily a bad sign or anything because they stress that their interviews don’t matter and a couple people did get in without interviews.\n\n**Essays**\n\nCommon App seemed good, from what I can tell. I had a few people (family friends, like professors and other students) look over it. It is about a conversation I had with my little brother about our favorite superpowers when we were little. I used our choices as metaphors for our personalities; mine being timid and his being outgoing. The rest of the essay was centered around how I grew to become more confident and display leader-like qualities.\n\nPrinceton and Yale supplementals sucked because they were the first few I worked on. Northwestern supplementals also could’ve been better because I added it last minute.\n\nOtherwise, essay quality seemed solid. I followed College Essay Guy’s tips on how to write each supplemental. I will note that the time spent working on supplementals and the results had virtually no correlation. Moreover, I only had my mom look over them.\n\nNot sure how I could numerically rate essay quality, tbh.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n**20 Schools: 4 Acceptances, 3 Waitlists, 13 Rejections**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Emory (both Atlanta and Oxford Campuses) RD - Major: Quantitative Sciences, which is basically Data Science\n   * Rejected from Woodruff Scholarship (Full Ride) at both campuses\n   * Not very affordable for my family\n* UNC Chapel Hill RD (Out of state) – Major: Statistics and Analytics\n   * I applied to this mostly because of the Robertson Scholarship, which I didn’t get.\n* University of South Florida (Out of state) – Major: Biomedical Sciences\n   * Full ride for National Merit Scholarship, eligible for 7-year BS/MD program (however, the MCAT requirement is insane).\n* T100 Instate school – Major: Applied Mathematics\n   * Near full ride (based on grades and course rigour)\n\n*Waitlists (I’m going to remain on all of these, in case one of them comes through and ends up being affordable; However, EFC indicates that all of them are going to cost as much as Emory, so I am not too hopeful here):*\n\n* Columbia – Major: Statistics\n* Vanderbilt – Major: Math\n* Rice – Major: Social Policy Analysis (Sociology + Statistics, essentially)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Yale REA\n* UChicago ED2 (This one really hurt; I tried to be as quirky as I could on my essays here and genuinely had so much fun writing them. EFC was also by far the cheapest of every school, so I could’ve easily afforded this place had I gotten in.)\n* Brown RD\n* Caltech RD\n* Cornell RD\n* Duke RD\n* Harvard RD\n* Johns Hopkins RD\n* Northwestern RD\n* Princeton RD\n* Stanford RD\n* Swarthmore RD\n* Penn RD (This one also stung; I thought the PennApps attendance would help here. I wanted to ED1 here but concerns over finances stopped me.)\n\n**Additional Information/Reflections:**\n\nNot sure what I should’ve done better really, in terms of building a Curricular/Extracurricular profile. I guess I kinda wish I had done research and published somewhere. While it is by no means a requirement, I feel like a lot of high schoolers (at least in my area) are starting to do it now.\n\nFurthermore, I feel like the Emory acceptance and the multiple waitlists proves that my essays were good and taken seriously by the admissions officers reading my application.\n\nFinally, I wish I had applied to some slightly lower ranked schools (i.e. Boston University) for the potential of receiving merit aid.\n\nFeel free to leave any thoughts below (whether it be on my profile, school list, or anything else).", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1cbea6k/data_sciencesociology_asian_guy_kinda_succeeds/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1cbea6k/data_sciencesociology_asian_guy_kinda_succeeds/", "upvotes": 23, "num_comments": 12, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|SocSci", "query_matched": "profile review"}

Very likely about my engagement with him outside the classroom\n* AP Physics teacher (9/10): SUPER close with the dude. Talked about literally everything with him and came to his office hours super often to chat.\n* H. PreCalc teacher (7.5/10): Pretty close with her. DIdn't do the best in her class because of huge spike in family duties junior year. However, improved a LOT throughout the year and she told me how she emphasized that a ton in the rec)\n* Research Mentor (8/10): Super close with him. Harvard Alum. WOrked with him virtually for about a year on my research project. I've read his writing before because he needed to submit a rec for science fairs I was entering. Pretty good imo)\n* Guidance (10/10): Emotional ties with this dude. We connect a lot about sports and I stop by to talk with him nearly every single day.

She asked me weird ass questions like \"estimate how many barbers there are in NYC to the power of 10\" and \"if you were a fruit what fruit would you be.\" I though I absolutely fucked the up the interview but at the end she told me she really fucking loved my personality and knows I was under a lot of pressure after the questions so she \"slid me an opportunity under the table\" by giving me an hour after the interview to give her an essay with everyting I would like to rephrase or reword during my interview so she can build the strongest case for me possible)\n* Princeton (BEST one. Spoke for nearly 2.5 hours and found a lot of common interests in sports and poetry.

The conclusion was a bit rushed tbh.\n* Supps: I took a TON of risks with my supps. I don't think I can compete with most other CS applicants when it comes to ECs so I decided to just show more personality and tried to be more funny on supps. For Princeton's personality supp, I talked about how I wanted to learn photoshop to crop my face onto an uncle sam poster and making myself 8'5 blah blah (this went viral on the a2c subreddit recently bc of how funny it was. Check my past posts in profile if you wan read). For Harvard, I talked about shitting and flushing toilets for intellectual experience and helping my neighbor raise rent for his tenants for the \"elaborate on an EC\" supp. For Cornell, I wrote about picking underwear for girls (specifcally my little sister) for community essay. Rest assured, I worded all my supps well. I just wanted to write about unique topics to stand out more, even if it's interpreted badly by AOs. I'm honestly willing to take taht gamble cuz afterall, ivies and a lot of t20s are all crapshoots)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Decisions**\n\nAcceptances:\n\n* UMich LSA EA (Data Sci + Creative Writing, OOS)\n* UIUC EA (Data Sci + Info Sci, OOS)\n\nDeferrals/Waitlists:\n\n* Stony Brook EA (Computer Sci) <- This was my safety too LMFAOO\n\nRejections:\n\n* UPenn ED (Comp Sci)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Additional Info**\n\nI listed some extenuating circumstances on my common app. In my junior year, my family duties spiked up a shit ton because my father opened a restaurant in Manhattan and often stayed overnight at there. So, I became in charge of taking my little sister to her extracurricular classes around the city after school 3-4 times a week. I would often have to get home after my school and ECs, make dinner, and take her to her classes. By the time I got home each day, it would already be 9-10PM. On top of that, the train commute back and forth from school each day is about 2.5 hours. Junior year grades dropped a fair bit as a result.\n\nAs for college results, I was kinda shocked about UIUC. I decided to apply like an hour before the deadline and wrote my supps in like 30 mins lmao\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also added some awards from PSAL and NHS in additional info too", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1aoh0x3/asian_male_pulls_off_ea_schools_with_last_minute/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1aoh0x3/asian_male_pulls_off_ea_schools_with_last_minute/", "upvotes": 117, "num_comments": 86, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "profile review"}

Talked about majoring in STEM and minoring in humanities/music, which is what I want to do.\n\n**Essays**\n\n**Personal Statement -** Talked about not having a voice for the majority of my life due to my Chinese background and the expectation to be \"polite\" or quiet. 3 iterations of the essays, and started on them at the beginning of the summer.\n\n**Supplementals -** Spent anywhere from 1-5 days for each of the schools, but 2 weeks for Duke. Thought they were pretty good, had my brother and English teacher review Duke + others.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* UNC-Chapel Hill (Committed)\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* UIUC RD\n* Rice RD\n* NYU RD\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Duke Trinity RD\n* UPenn Wharton ED\n* MIT (Defer EA -> Reject RD)\n* CMU RD\n* GTech (Defer EA -> Reject RD)\n* Cornell RD\n* Columbia RD\n* Stanford RD\n* UVA RD\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nWas really sad about Duke, as I thought I had a chance of at least getting waitlisted. Not really sure where I went wrong for all of these waitlists and rejections, maybe scattered ECs and cliche personal statement? However, I don't really regret anything I did, as I believe my HS career has been full of growth for me, and everything I did, I did for myself and not for college clout or anything.

My caseworker eventually forced my foster parents to let me attend some lessons and use their computer for homework one hour every day, and it went up again after that.\n\n**Standardized Testing**\n\n* SAT I: 1530 (750RW, 780M)\n* AP/IB: AP Biology (5), AP Calculus BC (4), AP English Literature (5), AP Psychology (5)\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\n\n1. **MOSTEC / MITES** \\- I learned a lot about genomes!\n2. **Vice-Captain of Science Team** \\- Objectively speaking, my biggest achievement was probably breaking up a fistfight between two juniors who were both equally wrong about microbes.\n3. **Founder and President of Literature Club** \\- Six people joined! We have book circles and write reviews for the school newspaper.\n4. **Childcare** (36 hours/week) (64 hours/week during lockdown) I take care of my foster parents two biological children, a 12 years old girl and an 8 years old boy with low-functioning autism.\n5. **Housework** (5 hours/week) I'm responsible for cleaning, doing the laundry and making breakfast.\n6. **Writing poetry** \\- I wrote three poems every week for a year. Some of them were even decent! One got published in a very small magazine that nobody has heard of.\n7. **Folding origami** \\- I can make dinosaurs, foxes, rabbits, elephants, frogs, cranes and butterflies. (I'm still not sure if this actually counts as an EC)\n\n**Note:** I couldn't do a lot of extracurriculars since I wasn't allowed to participate in any activities outside home after school. (The science team and the literature club have meetings during lunch.)\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n1. **Scholastic Writing Awards** \\- Gold key for personal essay, bronze key for poetry\n2. **National Science Olympiad** \\- Some state silver medals\n3. **AIME** \\- Qualifier\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\nChemistry teacher (8/10) He told me that I was one of his best students, encouraged me to join the science team and even offered to write my LOR before I could ask!\n\nEnglish teacher (4/10) I did well in her class and she seemed to like me, but we didn't really have any personal connection.\n\nGuidance counselor (8/10) She was extremely supportive and really went out of her way to help me with everything! She seemed upset about some aspects of my home life and said that she would \"explain my circumstances\" in her letter. I have somewhat mixed feelings about what that might mean since I didn't want my application to be trauma porn for admission officers, but I also understand that she was trying to help me and (hopefully) knew what she was doing.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nEmory (8/10) We had a lot in common, and she seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say! She said that she thought I would be perfect for Emory and that she would write me a great recommendation.\n\nDuke (6/10) I think it went well? It felt a bit like an interrogation, but not in a bad way, if that makes sense? He told me at the end that he hoped I would get in, but in a tone that sounded like he didn't think it was very likely.\n\nStanford (?/10) We ended up talking about fantasy books for most of the interview. I have no idea if that's good or bad.\n\nHarvard (9/10) She asked me a lot about my goals for the future, so I mostly talked about how I want to use my education to help children in foster care and low-income families. I was worried that I came across as way too preachy about it, but she emailed me afterwards and told me that she had decided to start volunteering in a group home because of our conversation, which is amazing!!\n\n**Essays**\n\nMy personal statement was about a school librarian I met in middle school when I was in survival mode, barely passing my classes and hiding in the library because I was terrified of people. She told me I was intelligent, encouraged me to study more and even helped me with my homework, which made my grades rise from Ds and Cs to As. I explained how it made me realize how important it is for children to have someone who believes in them, and how I want to become that person for other disadvantaged children in the future. (8/10)\n\nI don't want to describe my supplements in detail since they include information that could identify me, but I focused on how reading novels helped me understand and empathise more with people from different backgrounds, while writing poetry gave me a way to examine myself. I also mentioned that I want to become a child psychiatrist. (6/10)\n\n**Decisions**\n\n(All RD except for Harvard where I initially applied REA and was deferred.)\n\nAcceptances\n\n* Harvard\n* Brown\n* Williams\n* Emory\n* Vassar\n* Stony Brook\n* Binghamton\n* Geneseo\n\nWaitlists\n\n* Stanford\n* Duke\n* Cornell\n* Barnard\n\nRejections\n\n* Yale\n* Princeton\n* Columbia\n* Johns Hopkins\n* Amherst\n* Colgate\n\nI'm still trying to figure out exactly why I got these results, especially since I've read so many profiles where people who were objectively better than me got rejected from the same schools. Some part of me feels almost guilty about it, but at the same time I'm also really happy, just in a somewhat shocked and confused way.\n\nWhen I first applied REA to Harvard, my main reason for wanting to go there was honestly just the prestige that comes with attending the school. I never assumed that getting into Harvard would solve all my problems, but I think that it could make some aspects of my life easier to be able to attach it to my name.\n\nI never really seriously thought that I would actually get in, so I didn't think about how it would be like to attend Harvard beyond that. But I've thought a lot about what I want to get out of college since then, and I've realized that Harvard might not actually be the best choice for me. I want to go somewhere with a supportive environment and a collaborative atmosphere, and everything I've read about Harvard makes it seem like an extremely competitive and somewhat elitist place. I won't have any safety net to fall on if I fail out of school, and even though I think I would survive at Harvard I'm worried about what the constant pressure would do to me in the process. (It's also a bit hard to ignore that their mascot looks like a masked serial killer from a very bad slasher movie.)\n\nAfter spending some time on this subreddit I'm also starting to feel like there are people on the waitlist who would probably cut off their own hand to get into Harvard, and with that in mind it feels almost a bit cruel to accept my place when I feel ambivalent about the school myself. I honestly felt a lot happier when my interviewer told me that she had decided to start volunteering at the group home than when I got accepted, and I'm still trying to figure out exactly what that means, but it feels significant in some way. Sorry if I'm rambling.\n\nSo basically I'm turning Harvard down for Brown. I know that it's also an Ivy League, but it seems a bit more relaxed than Harvard and their open curriculum looks great! I'm interested in a lot of different subjects, and I feel like Brown might give me more chances to explore them with less pressure about grades. And their mascot only looks slightly suspicious. The more I think about it I'm starting to realize that Brown actually makes me feel excited for the school itself in a way that Harvard just doesn't.\n\nI'm going to think the whole thing through again to make absolutely sure that I'm making the right decision, but right now I feel confident that Brown is the better choice for me, and I'm really looking forward to going there!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n(Re-reading my application, it makes me cringe a bit how much of it sounds like \"I'm a foster kid! Did I mention I'm a foster kid? I'm a foster kid!\" It's not something I usually talk about that much, and I feel like I come across as really obnoxious and self-pitying in some parts. At the same time, it is something that has shaped most of my high school experience, and I'm not sure how much I could have avoided mentioning it without leaving out important information. Sorry if it was annoying to read though!)", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/12aw6wu/asian_girl_in_foster_care_somehow_gets_into/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/12aw6wu/asian_girl_in_foster_care_somehow_gets_into/", "upvotes": 311, "num_comments": 62, "flair": "3.6+|1500+/34+|Other", "query_matched": "profile review"}

Peer Recommendation - Submitted since Dartmouth wanted it, was pretty good since my best friend wrote it - 8/10\n\n**Interviews**:\n\nHad Penn, Stanford, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, all went well\n\n**Essays**:\n\nCommon App - chose an extremely unique challenge, tied it to my main EC as well. everyone who read it loved it, including counselor, friends, seniors, college students, etc.\n\nUChicago - wrote some of my best essays here. Quirky essay revolved around a previous prompt that i edited a bit, and managed to connect a v niche thing to my ancestral heritage and culture. Why UChicago was also filled with unique experiences cuz of my sister.\n\nWharton - amazing essays according to all who read them, included a lot of specific stuff and stories as well.\n\nEssays for the rest were also decent I’d say, not something that’d make me an auto admit definitely, but pretty good i guess.\n\n**Decisions:**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* USC (EA) w/ Presidential Scholarship (half-tuition)\n* Northwestern University (RD)\n* NYU Stern (RD)\n* UCSD\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* UCLA\n* Dartmouth University (RD)\n* Columbia University (RD)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* UChicago EA → RD deferred, then rejected.\n* Harvard RD\n* Yale RD\n* Princeton RD\n* UPenn Wharton RD\n* Stanford RD\n* Duke RD\n* UC Berkeley\n\n**Thoughts**:\n\n**#1** \\- It didn't all work out the way I'd have wanted. NYU Stern is fucking great, I def know that, but can't help but feel a bit saddened by all the rejections, especially Wharton, given the amount of Wharton-specific stuff on my profile, as well as the LORs from Wharton-affiliated people, and the fact that my best essays were for them.\n\n**#2** \\- Another thing that could've affected me was that there were also some issues with my school since there was some drama regarding an applicant faking their resume, and that resulted in the school getting only 2 ivy acceptances in RD, while we have historically gotten more than 10 every year. We also got no acceptances from Duke, Stanford, or UChicago, despite historically getting at least 3-4, and having really great applicants this year.\n\n**#3** \\- Nevertheless, for all you internationals out there - there's a lot of luck involved in this process, especially if you're an applicant from an extremely competitive country like India or China. So definitely ensure that you've got good backups somewhere. I went all out for the USA, applying only to super-reaches because I knew that I had a good backup in India in case nothing worked out.\n\nKeep looking out for opportunities for all types of extracurriculars, since they're a really important part of your application, and definitely ensure that your essays don't look refined or artificial, they should be something that makes the AO feel a personal connection with you.\n\n**#4** \\- Most importantly, don't let college decisions ever define you or what you'll achieve in life. If y'all have any questions whatsoever, feel free to DM, I'll be down to help out. Good luck to my juniors, wish y'all the best!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/128eutr/indian_internationals_application_journey_has_a/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/128eutr/indian_internationals_application_journey_has_a/", "upvotes": 18, "num_comments": 12, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|Bus/Fin", "query_matched": "profile review"}

Director and tutor at a non-profit with 100+ volunteers. Had 450+ hours tutoring plus ran some in-person events. This was a huge commitment of mine.\n3. Science Research Club founder and co-president. Built my own projects (qualified for state fair but didn't win anything) and helped organize others' projects. Also got some guest speakers to come talk to us about their research/work.\n4. Civil air patrol + state rep for squadron. Had lots of leadership within my squadron and led color guard and STEM competitions (model rocketry and cyber stuff). Helped organize some state-wide events. \\[*If you don't know what CAP is, it's technically the \"auxiliary of the Air Force,\" but think of it like boy scouts but more military and aviation focused.*\\]\n5. Encampment Training NCO. Taught 116 cadets aerospace, character development, and leadership for a week. \\[*This is part of CAP. Encampment is like \"bootcamp\" but less intense and only for 1 week.

I'm part of our school's varsity math team and my regional ARML team. We compete a bunch and I help younger students. I qualified for our school's \"state\" team twice (basically the top 6-8 scorers in the county-level competitions at my school). Unfortunately, I've never made AIME :(.\n8. Student pilot. Pretty self explanatory. I fly and try to have as many takeoffs as landings. Had about 60 hours at the time of applications.\n9. Family restaurant. Been working since I was 11 and took on \\~40 hour/week during covid and summers. I do just about everything but cook.\n10. Amateur Tinkerer. Talked about some of my projects and hackathon participation. Nothing too big and nothing particularly notable. Just something I do for fun. (Happy to talk about this more if you'd like).\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\n*List all awards and honors submitted on your application.*\n\n1. Scholastic National Gold Medal\n2. 10th Place State Math Olympiad\n3. Individual placements on 2 college-hosted math competitions\n4. AFROTC+ROTC Scholarships\n5. 2 Smaller Hackathons with 40-50 participants each.\n\n**Letters of Recommendation**\n\n(*Briefly describe relationships with your recommenders and estimated rating.)*\n\nAP Chemistry. I loved the class but was a touch hyper in it. I did well but there was a kid doing USNCO in the class so I was definitely not the best. According to my guidance counselor though, she writes good recs though and she knows a lot about my research stuff so 8/10.\n\nAP Lit. I won the scholastic medal while in her class and she actually started a short-story unit after the AP exams for that (I'd won in the flash fiction category). She was also the mom of a soccer teammate of mine so I'm sure the rec was at least OK. However, I'd say that I was a lot closer to the science department than the English department as a whole so I'd guess that my AP Chem one would have been better. 7/10.\n\n**Interviews**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on interview experiences, if applicable.)*\n\nI talked too quickly during my Duke interview and really could've done a lot better. I'd say it was OK but not outstanding 7/10.\n\nI ended up doing a lot of interviews this year (I think 7) so I'm a little disappointed my Duke one didn't go too well.\n\n**Essays**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\n\nAha. Essays. I stayed up until like 2AM on halloween writing essays for all my EA/ED schools. Duke's essays took from September and I ended up picking the community and best academic activity essays for my supps. The community one was copy/pasted from USC's version of the prompt just swapping USC for Duke. (BTW, all schools' supps should be like USC. Maybe its just the wording of their prompts but their essays were so easy to write.) I talked about food and a CAP potluck.  7.5/10\n\nThe best academic activity was written about my internship and I somehow turned the conclusion into a diversity essay. 2AM brain is very interesting. 7/10\n\nMy \"why duke\" essay touched on my tinkering and connected my past endeavors to what I hoped to do in Duke. I also mentioned wanting to be part of the gardening community there to really tie in my main common app essay. I feel the structure is a bit boring but the content is there. 7/10\n\nMy personal statement was the only one I paid to have reviewed (shoutout to bettercollegeapps) and I basically talk about learning to ask for help through gardening with my dad. I tied in a little bit of engineering (built an aquaponics system) and thought I used a little bit of well-placed humor. Overall, pretty proud of it. 8/10\n\nAs for the rest of the essays, I'd say my USC essays were 7.5-8/10 and all other essays were like 6/10. I'm not creative enough to use 100 words to write meaningful, non-cookie cutter essays.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Duke ED (committed)\n* Kettering (rolling)\n* Milwaukee School of Engineering (rolling)\n\n*Other (For my fellow service academy people!)*\n\n* USAFA LOA\n* West Point LOE\n\n*Withdrawn applications*\n\n* USC\n* UIUC\n* UMass Amherst\n* Purdue\n* Northeastern\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nI tried my best to get some sort of theme going throughout my application despite having a lot of things that don't really connect too much. I tried to use my essays to demonstrate that every one of my activities does sort of follow that STEM/engineering spike.\n\nI guess my biggest advice is to be enthusiastic. Sayings like \"Dont do things for the sake of college apps\" is overdone and isn't stopping anyone from doing just that (heck, over half of my ECs were done just for college apps.) But, once you choose to start something, regardless of why you started it, find something that makes you excited about it. That thing or that group will make you far more motivated to do more and do better and be more innovative/creative/positive than college apps. Others pick up on that energy and it'll lead to better things and more opportunities.\n\nI don't think my profile is nearly as strong as those I've seen on reddit or even those I've seen irl. I feel like most of my profile are things that most people can do really realistically so I hope that this gives people some hope!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/zwjweo/duke_engineering_ed_results/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/zwjweo/duke_engineering_ed_results/", "upvotes": 52, "num_comments": 27, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "profile review"}

The magnet status is the reason that I was allowed to give my weighted GPA for all GPA questions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: Can't believe I forgot about this, but an important detail. In the Fall at Brandeis, I applied to the SEED program (Students Exploring and Embracing Diversity). While I was unable to get a spot, they said my application showed I was hard-working and a good student. They waived my application fee based on this. So I definitely recommend showing interest in schools that you want to go to. That may sound obvious, but documented interest stands out in applications. For example, when Colorado State and Brandeis representatives visited my school, they had people who attended their info session documented so that later on, they could refer back to that list when looking at applications.

My US history teacher wrote one, and I am lucky enough to have her as a dorm advisor, meaning she has lived with me for 3 years. She and I have a tight relationship and I did extraordinarily well in her class—I’d rate it a 9.5/10. My calculus teacher wrote my other academic rec, and again we got along really well and I did really well in her class—8.5/10. My college counselor wrote my counselor rec, and he and I are top tier buds—10/10.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nNah I literally don’t remember any of them… they were decent, I think. I had EA interviews for each school that offered them (MIT and Case Western), and I’ve done RD interviews whenever offered (Carleton, Grinnell, Cornell, Harvard, Yale, Harvey Mudd, URochester). I did not get an interview for Columbia.\n\n**Essays**\n\nI think my essays are really, really strong. My CA personal statement discussed how I’ve explored different aspects of my identity (namely socioeconomic status and sexuality) through shitty fashion; I think it displayed who I am (not only these named identifiers but also personality) very effectively. I also believe my supplemental essays were good. My college counselor is using them as examples for future students.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Indiana University (CS, $11k/yr merit)\n\n* Purdue University (CS)\n\n* University of Rochester (Applied math, $25k/yr merit)\n\n* Carleton College (CS)\n\n* Grinnell College (CS, $27k/yr merit)\n\n* University of Michigan (CS, LSA)\n\n* Harvey Mudd College (CS/math, full tuition merit finalist)\n\n* California Institute of Technology (CS) (*COMMITTED!!!!

Right at the end of the first semester of my freshman year, my mom attempted suicide in front of me. My dad took custody of me (they divorced when I was 4) and I moved halfway across the state. She bounced in and out of jail that year. During my sophomore year, she jumped out of a window and broke three parts of her spine, landing her in a medically-induced coma. This same year, I applied to boarding schools and ended up repeating my sophomore year of high school voluntarily due to the educational gap between my past low-income high school and my new school. During my second sophomore year, she was sentenced to 6 months in jail and 18 months on house arrest. I don’t want to victimize myself in any way, and I don’t want sympathy, but these events heavily impacted my academics in high school.\n\n**Reflections:**\n\nMy advice to everyone going through the app process is to not be afraid to be a fucking mega dork in your application. I wrote about fucking Naruto and robotics whenever I could, and I got some damn good results.\n\nI wrote down some advice, if you so care:\n\n* Go with your gut! There were so many times throughout the application process where I just didn't trust myself and my choices. My gut feeling was to go test optional at MIT, and I didn't—now I'm just left with the \"what ifs\". Also, it is totally okay to judge colleges for yourself based on vibes. You don't need some massive concrete, statistic reason to not apply to a school. If you get any bad vibe from it, then trust yourself.  It's maybe not an awful idea to go with your gut feeling when you choose a school to attend, either. You'll be spending ~4 years there; you don't want to be miserable.\n\n* Don't doubt yourself!! I applied to a lot of reaches, but there were some schools I didn't apply to because for some reason I weirdly doubted I'd get in. I'm super happy with where I'm going, of course, but I wish I would've applied to Stanford!! I just did not think I would get in, so I didn't even bother trying.\n\n* Don't fear rejection. If there's a school you really like, even if you feel like you have no chance at getting in, APPLY ANYWAY!\n\n* If you qualify for fee waivers, use them! I did not pay for a single college application-related expense, and it saved my ass so much. Please don't feel embarrassed or shameful or anything—utilize these amazing resources.\n\n* If you are an underrepresented applicant, APPLY TO FLY-INS!!! So many top schools have fly-ins (MIT, Caltech, Dartmouth, Columbia, etc. etc.) and they're super helpful with learning more about a school, especially within the lens of being from an underrepresented background. Also, I don't know if they necessarily *help* you to get into a school, but there is a correlation between attending a fly-in and being admitted to a school. However, if you get rejected from the fly-in, that doesn't mean you have no chance at that school. I got rejected from Columbia's fly-in, yet I got a likely and a special scholar designation. My friend got rejected from Swarthmore's fly-in but was accepted into the school RD. \n\n* Be YOU in your essays. Don't be afraid of being conversational, in a way. I write the way I talk, and I got a lot of notes post-acceptance from schools saying that the AOs really got to know me through my essays and that they really appreciated reading my voice. If you naturally write a bit less or a bit more personal, that's totally okay—just don't try to force yourself into a different writing voice for your essays. I feel like that is where a lot of students struggle.\n\n* If you need financial aid, complete your FAFSA and CSS profile AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!! Colleges are pains in the ass when it comes to finaid documentation. The quicker you submit your shit, the earlier you can iron out any issues within them, and you can avoid issues with receiving aid due to time.\n\n* STAY OFF R/CHANCEME. EVERY SINGLE COMMENTER ON THERE HAS ABSOLUTELY NO CLUE WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT!!! I was super anxious entering application season, and used r/chanceme more than once. I was repeatedly told I had no chance at MIT or Caltech and that my scores and GPA were way too low for any top school's CS program. Clearly, they were very wrong. That subreddit is nothing but toxic and just blatantly incorrect. Please save yourself the worry!\n\n* Don't get caught up in comparing yourself to other applicants, especially in self-selecting spaces like A2C. Every single person is different, and there's no one type of applicant that is correct. If you have no research, or no work experience, or whatever, THAT'S PROBABLY COMPLETELY FINE!! You are yourself, and nobody else. Do what you love and do what you can do, because you are different from any other applicant. \n\n* Be kind to yourself. No matter what your application results are, you are worthy of love and praise.\n\nI don’t know. Don’t take my advice. I’m 19 and stupid as fuck.

He only taught me once, for one class, and it was all online, so I'm not really all so sure how I proved myself to him lol.\n\nEnglish Teacher (8/10) - My favorite teacher! He's said multiple times that he thinks I'm a good writer, and we're pretty close overall. \n\nGuidance Counselor (9/10) - Communicated a lot with her throughout junior and senior year and she's familiar with a lot of my extracurriculars.\n\nPiano Teacher (7/10) - Not as important since it was extra, but my piano teacher went through a round of editing with me and wanted to help my application! He wrote really nice things, but I'm not sure if it really helped at all.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nYale - Loved this interview. I got to nerd out why I loved Yale and the interviewer noted that Yale looks for people with a good balance of academic and personal life. He noted that my mentality and my attitude of academics for passion matched well with Yale. I think I did alright, pretty good review but not a stand-out among the stand-outs.\n\nPrinceton - My favorite and best interview, imo. I got to talk about the things I'm most passionate in and got to divulge in my major (comp lit) and why I chose it. I think I presented myself really well and I really enjoyed talking with my interviewer.\n\nPenn - Probably the oddest conversation I've ever had with anyone ever. Interviewer was in the process of moving and only asked me one question. I received the interview offer within 24 hours of submitting my Penn application so I guess that's a green flag ?\n\n**Essays**\n\nMajor procrastinator–I wrote most of my essays within 72 hours of their deadline. My strength is in writing, so I would say that creatively, they're fairly good, and I'm very familiar with personal essays. I tried to be as creative as possible and present all the different aspects of me I wanted to share. I'd probably say they were the strongest part of my application because they were completely unique to me, not just in content but in writing style, and I gave a general picture of my entire self (cultural identity, biggest passions, niche interests, my major, my travels, my family, etc.)\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* *4/4 Safeties*\n* Boston College \n* Vassar\n* Wesleyan\n* Barnard (+ Scholar of Distinction)\n* **Penn (CAS) -> attending**\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* UChicago\n* Johns Hopkins\n* Northeastern\n* Columbia\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* Harvard\n* Princeton\n* Yale (REA deferred)\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\nThank you to this subreddit, its members, and anyone reading this for creating this community. I've spent countless hours on this website solely for college admissions throughout middle school and high school, and an embarrassing amount of time making fake versions of an r//collegeresults post. Though I have *a lot* of disdain for college admissions culture and the toxicity of these subreddits, I can't help but look back on my time obsessing over my profile as the 'good old days.' It's all over, thank God.\n\nI won't lie or sugarcoat, by the time my junior year started (100% digital learning btw), I gave up on my \\~Ivy League, Top 20, elite institution\\~ dreams entirely. I faced a lot of mental health issues all throughout high school, and especially in the first half, I think I went through a lot. I still had a lot of drive and a high GPA, but I lost hope for these elite PWI's and wanted to force myself to let go as to not be naive. I didn't want get hurt in the end, prove that I really was a fool, or stake my self worth in rich, billion dollar endowment businesses (cough–I mean schools).\n\nBut I'm a dreamer and a very idealistic, perfectionistic type of person. And I fake-believed-in-myself so hard that I made it; I more than 'made it'. I committed to Penn about two weeks with a friend on call that really means a lot to me and I got to celebrate for a few minutes with him. Hearing him say that he was proud and that I really worked for it, wow I don't think I've felt that genuinely proud of myself in a long time.\n\nIf I have any advice to give that'd you reading would want, it'd be to get off this subreddit asap and just *start now*. Believe in yourself, and give yourself some grace. Trust the process. I got really, really lucky but at the same time, I know without my efforts and the support of those around me, I wouldn't have gotten to where I am today.\n\n**My dm's are completely open!** This is a throwaway account, but I'll make sure to be active just in case anyone has a question.

Though, given my results for outside the UC system, it probably didn't make a big impact. \n\n**Interviews - didn't get a lot, and they were pretty straightforward**\n\n**UMich:** Great. Super friendly interviewer working in the Biotech industry. The conversation was lengthy and honestly quite fun.\n\n**Rochester:** Pretty chill. Involved the interviewer spending a good amount of time answering my questions about pre-med and the research environment at Rochester.\n\n**Case Western:** Pretty much same quality as the UMich one, except the interviewer was a current pre-med student so the conversation took a turn in that direction instead of BME.\n\n**Essays**\n\n**Common App:** Honestly pretty good imo. Wrote a genuine explanation about how being the child of H-1B parents (skill-based visa for context) involved a great deal of fear and identity crisis from 3rd - 8th grade. Learned to channel that uncertainty about our visa status (given the sporadic nature of visa denial in the H1 program) into motivation and a work ethic. Idk the essay could've come off as soppy, but I put a good amount of time and effort into it.\n\n**UC Essays** were based mainly on anecdotes from clubs, orgs, other work-related ec's, and how those shaped my character/provided opportunities for problem-solving. Similar pattern for supplementals.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* UCSD (Biotechnology Major)\n* UC Santa Barbara\n* UC Irvine\n* UC Riverside\n* UC Merced\n* **UC Berkeley (Bioengineering Major) -** ***Committed!!!***\n* UC Davis\n* UC Santa Cruz\n* Case Western Reserve University (*15k per year scholarship offered*) - Applied by PPSM deadline, rejected from PPSM but accepted for undergrad BME\n* University of Rochester - Applied by REMS deadline, rejected from REMS but accepted for undergrad BME\n* Rutgers  - EA, rejected from BSMD but accepted for undergrad BME\n* Penn State - EA, rejected from BSMD but accepted for undergrad Pre-Med major\n* Saint Louis University (SLU) - RD, applied to Medical Scholars Program *and accepted (oh boy, I have a LOT to say about this in Additional Information)*\n* UIUC - RD\n\n*Waitlists:*\n\n* UMich - EA (deferred to RD round, then waitlisted)\n\n*Rejections:*\n\n* UCLA\n* MIT - RD\n* Harvard - RD\n* Stanford - REA\n* Columbia - RD\n* Yale - RD\n* Cornell - RD\n* Brown - RD (applied PLME too, rejected obviously)\n* University of Pennsylvania - RD\n* Duke - RD\n* Boston University (applied to BSMD too) - RD\n* Johns Hopkins - RD\n* USC - RD\n* Northwestern - RD\n\n**Additional Information (very long I know, my weird \"intl\" status as an applicant is covered here)**\n\nI**nternational status:**\n\nAs mentioned in my Common App topic, I'm technically an H4 visa holder (dependent of H1-B visa holders). That complicated things quite a bit. Despite living in the states for a decade,  I was an *international applicant for admissions purposes* (even for UCs even though we are California residents) for pretty much all these schools. My dumbass also said \"yes\" to the requesting financial aid question on Common App for some of the privates, not knowing what it means, though I followed up with those schools and confirmed that me filling out no financial aid paperwork would mean I'm not an applicant with the \"requesting aid\" label. In the context of tuition for UCs, **I've looked a LOT into this. Filled out an SLR and thankfully UC Berkeley (and pretty sure every other UC) follows a separate set of rules for** ***residency for tuition purposes (separate from the admissions rules).*** I should qualify for in-state tuition, but that's actually a TBD in the next few weeks depending on the results of my SLR. Wish me luck :)\n\n**SLU mEdiCaL SchOlarS proGram, thoughts pre-Berkeley, etc:**\n\nOK so let's talk about this SLU Medical Scholars program. In my quest for BSMDs that accepted \"international\" applicants, I came across this program. After getting accepted, I was hyped because the stats online from different sites showed that it's pretty much just as competitive as any BSMD (which equated to the program's legitimacy in my mind at that time). **Here's the catch (and something future BSMD applicants should note): unlike a typical BSMD, meeting the academic requirements while in the Medical Scholars program (only GPA for SLU, other BSMDs require some level MCAT too) does NOT guarantee admissions to the SLU medical school. It only offers the opportunity to APPLY to the medical school during your sophomore year (no stats can be found regarding SLU med school acceptance rate through this path).**  This REALLY caught me off guard (and truthfully pissed me off), because from what I can tell this really isn't the norm in BSMDs. **It also was never specified on the SLU informational pages that I read** during the application process. So yea, just some food for thought. As for my overall results, I'd say I'm satisfied. The total wash from the east coast was a bit of a surprise since I imagined I'd land one big-time private. However, given geography and my school being more so a UC feeder, I'm not beating myself up over it. I've heard a lot of not-so-good things about how Berkeley's College of Engineering doesn't really mesh with a pre-med's aspiration for a high GPA. I am quite set on medical school as Plan A, so I guess I'll have to work my way through those challenges at Cal. I do find some comfort in the fact that Cal's percentage of pre-meds who get into med school is decently high for a large public school (56% ish). Prestige isn't everything, but nevertheless, I can't complain about landing a brand name like Cal.

An amazing essay will differentiate your application from the rest.\n\nAlso, I think it's important that you develop a theme for your application. Mine was tailored around environmental science and Spanish, which I think added a level of transparency and clarity.

All through high school, I felt really insecure because I always felt like I had to compare myself to my classmates who were starting non profits and playing a ton of sports and were involved in like every club lol. I never thought that I would get into my dream school (MIT) because I'm not really a STEM person and wanted to go there for their econ department. Even if I hadn't gotten in, I would just say that high school is a time to really figure out who you are and even if I hadn't gotten into this amazing schools which I'm extremely grateful for, I would still have been happy because I learned so much in school.

{"id": "m7lvo1", "subreddit": "collegeresults", "author": "thatasianbobaaddict", "created_utc": 1616054014.0, "title": "An Emotionally Exhausted Senior's Advice to Fellow Sad Seniors Facing Rejections and Disappointment", "selftext": "Several hours pass by as you sign in and out and in and out of college application portals, anxiously waiting for an update. It’s been months since you’ve submitted your college applications and in mere seconds you click to find out your fate. Three options await you: rejected, waitlisted, accepted.\n\nYou hover your mouse over the link, take a deep breath, and click, but your heart drops as you read the words “cannot offer admission”. Your eyes water with tears, ready to burst. At first, this rejection will feel like the end of your life. If you can’t get into this school, how can you possibly get into all the other schools you’ve applied to and are waiting to hear from?\n\nAs your mind continues on this downward spiral, you begin to contemplate what you could have done wrong. And when you hear your friends or classmates got into the same school, you are proud, but deeply saddened and envious at the same time. You immediately compare yourself to your friends and make assumptions that you’re “not smart enough”, “not accomplished enough”, “not interesting enough”.\n\n“Enough”. The feeling of not being “good enough” is a universal emotion that all high school seniors experience during the college application process. It is the only thing guaranteed by the whole process really. This is a very sad but true fact. (Rarely do students ever get into all of the schools they applied to. Often do students cry their eyes out and bawl. Fun fact, I for one am a really ugly crier. I hope you all do not suffer from the same misfortune as I do.) So, the idea of “being good enough” for a college is talked about constantly, but what does “being enough” really mean? How do you determine your self worth? By the prestige of the college you attend? By the acceptance rate of the college which you attend? Or do you determine your self worth by the positive change you create in the world and the people whose lives you have touched?\n\nFor years you’ve been told the most important thing to focus on in high school is college. Getting into a college. But not just getting into any college, getting into a GOOD college. And I have to ask you, what does a “good” college even constitute? Is a “good” college a college with a well known name? A college that produces the most famous alumni? Or a college that supports you and helps you in your journey to succeed? This is not to say that a prestigious college cannot be and do both things, but to ask you to reconsider what is really most important to you. Are you interested in a college because of its prestige or because it fits your needs and wants in a school?\n\nAs you concentrate on getting accepted into a “good” college right now, I urge you to focus on what is truly best for you and not what “looks” the best. This may come as a shock to many of you (That was pure sarcasm to be clear.), but you DO NOT need to get into an Ivy League school to be successful. There are many people who attended community college and are successful. And I want to note that they are/were successful NOT in spite of the college they attended, but because of who they are/were as people and how hard they worked. Steve Jobs, Morgan Freeman, Walt Disney, Eddie Murphy, Halle Berry, Queen Latifah, James Dean, Arnold Schwarzenegger... And well, if I’m honest, being a White person certainly helps a lot, but that’s not my point here. My list could probably go on and on and on, but this post is already too long and I really want you to finish reading my post until the end.\n\nAnyway, my point is that if everybody needed to go to any Ivy League level school, we’d all be screwed. And all this is to say that you DON’T need to attend an Ivy League level school to be successful. The vast majority of the human population has not attended an Ivy League level school. So before you find yourself feeling unworthy, unaccomplished, or stupid for applying to colleges you got rejected by, please remember how dangerous and harmful it is to equate your self worth to the name and reputation of the college you attend. It is completely and wholly unnecessary. Nobody will ask at your funeral in the future what college you attended because it truly doesn’t matter as much as you think it does right now. That probably sounds really harsh, but it's true.\n\nSo if you are currently dealing with insecurities about your self worth, I want to tell you that I’ve been there, and I am still dealing with my insecurity as I continue to hear back from colleges this application cycle. But I think I have learned a lot throughout my college application process, and most importantly what I have learned and am continuing to learn about is that you CAN and SHOULD only focus on what is in your control. We all know that everybody dies at some point, but we don’t live our whole lives obsessing over when we will die and how we will die and where we will die because like the colleges we get rejected from, we do not have complete control in these situations. I understand that’s an extreme example, but I used it because I know that way too many students each year fall into severe depression over the colleges they are rejected from and I don’t want this to happen to all of you or myself. College is only 4 years of your life and most people live up to around 80, so even though college feels like the scariest and most important thing in your life, it is not. Your college years will only make up a very tiny and minor percentage of your whole life (By the way, the math result is 5% for those like me who are not mathematically inclined.).\n\nYou have worked for months and years preparing for college applications only for the admissions officers to quickly read your numerous essays and student profile in mere minutes. You have tried your absolute best and stayed up numerous nights checking and rereading essay after essay for any mistakes. But as soon as your application is sent to the college for review, the control leaves your hands and then you have done pretty much everything you can really do. The reality of the college admission process is that admissions officers only learn a small snippet of the characteristics, qualities, quirks, and achievements that make up who you are. After all, they only have so much time to review your application and you only have so large of a word count to sum up the complicated explanation of who you are as a person and why. That is exactly why I think it is important to not take rejection so personally because you are bigger than the name of the college you ultimately attend. And I know firsthand that it’s incredibly difficult, but do not let these admissions officers undermine your self confidence and invalidate your achievements. You have worked too hard for many years to let people who you don’t even know and don’t even know you tear you down. Also, their decision to accept you, reject you, or put you on the waitlist is based more on luck than you might know. Small factors such as how much sleep they got the night before or whether they were hungry while reading your application do have some impact on their decision to an extent.\n\nSo before you spend time obsessing over your rejection, please ask yourself this: would you rather attend a college that wants you or a college that doesn’t want you? In my opinion, you should attend a college that wants you. So when you’re rejected from a school, there is nothing else you can do but move on. You deserve to be wanted. You deserved to feel praised and accomplished. You have worked so hard and come so far, so do not look back, dwelling on what could’ve been. The past is the past and cannot be changed, but the future is what you make of it. You can choose to move forward and make the most out of your experience at whatever college you attend. This choice is within your power and control. Please remember it is not the prestige of the college that decides how successful you’ll be in the future because ultimately your success is up to you. If you cannot live in the present, you’ll be stuck in the past. And if you are stuck in the past, you cannot see the future. To my fellow Seniors, you have much ahead of you and will go on to achieve many great things. Do not let the results of your college applications block your sight from seeing what is truly important.\n\nAs colleges continue to send out decisions, do allow yourself to be sad and take time to heal. It is important to validate your feelings. I am not at all trying to say that you don’t deserve to be sad after being rejected from a college. I just hope you remember that at the end of the day, you can only focus on what you can control. And what you can control is how you respond and whether you continue onward. So please do not allow college decisions to take up your mind all day. Colleges that reject you DO NOT at all deserve any part of your mental space or any further thought after a couple cathartic sessions of crying in the shower.\n\nOn a side note, I know I keep repeating the same words over and over again, but it is about 12:30 AM and I am exhausted from writing this. It’s taken me almost three hours, so if my post has helped you in any way, please tell me and feel free to share anything you’ve learned along the way while applying to and hearing back from colleges. Also, please leave any constructive criticism or thoughts. I’m always open to learning more and looking at issues from different perspectives. I’m very curious as to how people will respond to this post, but first the bigger issue is who is crazy enough to read a post this long? If you’ve read this ending statement, congratulations for having an attention span longer than a TikTok video or being as impatient as I am and immediately skipping to the end! Either way, thank you so much for considering my measly thoughts and opinions whether you agree, disagree, or clicked off this post as soon as you saw how long it is. Anyway, I wish everybody the best of luck with their college decisions and I’m rooting for everybody! You can get through this hard time and know that it's okay to have ups and downs. Also know that we can't all smile constantly. Life is kind of like a sin wave: really frustrating and annoyingly fluctuant.\n\nUpdate (3/26/21): Hi everyone, I just wanted to share an update about my college notification decisions. So far, I have been rejected from 4 schools, waitlisted at 3 schools, and accepted by 7 schools. I’m still waiting to hear back from 5 schools.\n\nFor all those who feel like they are the only ones being rejected or waitlisted by colleges, please know you're not the only one. We can get through this together if we believe in ourselves.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/m7lvo1/an_emotionally_exhausted_seniors_advice_to_fellow/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/m7lvo1/an_emotionally_exhausted_seniors_advice_to_fellow/", "upvotes": 532, "num_comments": 22, "flair": "Meta", "query_matched": "profile review"}

Paralysis led me to writing my common app essay 2 days before the deadline and all my supplemental essays on the day of, if not 4 to 3 hours before.\n\nAt the time, I thought my essays were quite good despite the time crunch but in retrospect they were pretty ass. I wrote about what I thought the admissions team wanted to hear, trying to show them that i'm well educated in a lot of different things and am a critical thinker etc. and it just came off superficial. I got rejected from basically everywhere lol, to no one's surprise. I was sad and begrudgingly committed to my current school.\n\nWhen I started college, I felt pretty disillusioned with the college admissions process but was still set on trying again via transfer. I worked hard on my ECs, got good recs, and did decent in my classes. when it came to write, like last year, I kind of froze again and wasn't able to start until the very last couple of days. it was a scramble again to submit everything. (this is a tangent but I think i have like a chronic procrastination issue, does anyone know how to fix this lol).\n\nThis time around though, i found the writing process to be a lot easier. First of all, the common app essay is no longer a personal statement like it was in high school--there's a more pre-determined structure to it, as it now becomes a \"transfer statement\" essay. I wrote about how my interest in math started, what I did to explore it, and then why transfer matters in that context. So i wasn't stressing out over coming up with a super creative story like I saw others do in their common app essay in high school. As for the supps, the prompts are the exact same as what high schoolers have to write with the exception of some \"Why Transfer?\" essays. I approached my supps by sitting down very honestly with the prompt, blocking out any thoughts related to admissions/college, and just genuinely asked myself \"what do I think about/how would I answer this question?\"\n\nfor example, for the brown supplemental with the prompt \"what brings you joy in your day to day life,\" i simply answered... truthfully. I didn't try to tie it back to brown in any way or try to meticulously craft it in such a way that the AO would think that i'm really empathic or intellectually curious or whatever superficial image you can think of. I wrote about how classical music makes me feel happy inside and how I love Chopin a lot. maybe this is obvious to a lot of people already, but it definitely wasn't to my high school self, so I'm including this here anyways.\n\nYes I'm rambling now so I will wrap up by sharing what I've learned through this whole experience:\n\n1. Don't give up on what you care about\n2. I think the hardest thing to game in the admissions process are your essays, so I'd recommend spending that energy just writing an honest essay instead. If I could to tell my HS senior self something, it'd be that\n3. As you can see, my GPA is not ideal for ivy standards. i've never had straight As in ANY year of high school. always at least one B. I actually don't know how I didn't get rejected everywhere again because I thought 3.9+ is strongly preferred from everything I read in the TTT25 subreddit. I do think my essays were quite good though--but self-evaluation is always a fine line so I'll be cautious of saying that. I guess this just goes to show that 1) holistic admissions is real, 2) don't listen to what a bunch of uninformed randoms have to say on the internet. trust yourself and other REAL people (I talked to other successful transfers from my school). I was on that subreddit a lot my first semester and it was literally killing my braincells reading a bunch of bots arguing with each other in the comments. I dropped it entirely after realizing that and my mental became a lot better + I focused on things that were actually productive.\n4. A lot of this is just luck, unfortunately and fortunately. it means someone like me, who doesn't have ISEF or IMO or USACO, can get in. But it also means many people who have those awards get rejected.\n5. I think a part of my acceptance to columbia was the fact that I had taken classes that got me substantial credits in classics and philosophy, which is important for their Core. I have a feeling (and it makes reasonable sense) that Columbia won't admit students who'd be super behind in the Core or else they can't graduate on time. this applies even more strongly to Junior applicants, who have less time to complete the core.\n6. Please feel free to AMA, dms or in the comments! i'd really like to help others out bc I know it's rough.\n\noverall, pretty insane comeback but I'm extremely fortunate and grateful for everything I have", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1knonwm/high_school_failure_to_a_transfer_success/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1knonwm/high_school_failure_to_a_transfer_success/", "upvotes": 97, "num_comments": 16, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "ISEF"}

Advice though for anyone that also wants to do BSMD process:**  \nGrades + SAT incredibly important (1500+/3.8+UW) - don't sacrifice them by stretching yourself thin over many ECs. Though I have a bunch my time was mostly concentrated on research, theatre, and therapy assistant (STEM, hobby/humanities, community service/medicine).\n\nResearch is very good for programs (not needed but I recommend) and participating in science fairs is nice added benefit, but you don't need crazy awards like ISEF, instead learn good lessons from it like how to stay adaptable and resilient even when experiments go wrong.\n\nEssays: THERE are a lot of them. And the interviewer for New Jersey Medical School in open med school interview formats also gets to read them beforehand. Set time aside ideally in junior summer to really get to write all of them.\n\nShadowing: Very important to show that you have seen at least a glimpse of medicine. Calling hospitals is not the way, but find the emails of individual doctors and email directly. Another is if you have friends with doctor parents or connections and ask them.\n\nShow both diversity and commitment. I really enjoyed working at that therapy organization, research, and theater. Theater isn't a med/stem EC and shows I have other interests I really enjoy. Show that you have tried things outside of academics and that you understand that a medical career isn't the only profession you could pursue. Find something that you really enjoy **completely outside** academics that you can talk about.\n\nECs that allow direct professional patient/person relationship: therapy work, customer service jobs, caretaker facility work. All of this can be useful to show that you've directly impacted and worked with people/patients in some ways more than hospital volunteering, EMT, etc.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jxorh9/done_the_impossible_parents_said_theyre_proud_in/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1jxorh9/done_the_impossible_parents_said_theyre_proud_in/", "upvotes": 142, "num_comments": 32, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "ISEF"}

As another user here said, just because you were rejected from a summer program, you’re not “cooked.\" I learned SO MUCH from my summer apps, and I don't think I would have gotten in had I not learned from the mistakes I made applying there.\n\nI did not think I would get into all these schools. By any stretch of the imagination. I opened status update optimistically praying for a deferral - I had a whole plan - I applied REA to Yale so that I could be deferred, and then with amazing LOCI updates, the fact that I originally applied REA would the tiny factor that pushed me over the edge, if I got in at all. It just goes to show that no matter how convinced you are that you'll be rejected/deferred you *literally never know*. Tech is also now a huge contender for me, which I never expected.\n\nI think I've mastered the college app process in this journey - writing and revising essays  over and over again was painstaking, but I became insanely good at it, and I'm really blessed and proud of how things turned out. I am offering test prep and zoom essay review for these next few weeks at a price much lower than most essay reviewers I could find when writing my application - if anyone wants, please PM!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1hioofc/it_happened/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1hioofc/it_happened/", "upvotes": 101, "num_comments": 65, "flair": "3.8+|1100+/22+|STEM", "query_matched": "RSI"}

Talked about special family circumstances.\n\n**Reflection/Advice:**\n\n1. The college admissions process can be unpredictable but it isn't random: Your essays, personality, and extracurriculars are extremely important. There are tons of people on this subreddit with extraordinary qualifications that definitely are capable of performing well at a T10 school, but many don't gain admission. My best advice to anyone is focus less on maximizing your awards/ECs and focus more on enjoying what you do. Throughout high school, I've found great enjoyment and fun in all the activities I participate in. Your essays should reflect that you are a genuine person who has a personality outside academics—what do you do for fun?, are you kind to other people around you?, are you curious?, etc.\n2. Don't place so much emphasis on landing a top school: Trust me, there's (most probably) going to be a point where you're getting rejection/waitlist after rejection/waitlist. I was in the same position, but what I came to realize amidst these rejections was that I would've been happy at my state school as well. Your activities shape you as a person—if you're genuinely passionate about them, it doesn't matter whether or not you get into a college because of them, you still gained valuable skills/learned something.\n3. You're probably not going to get into your dream school: My dream school was MIT. My second dream school was Harvard. My third choice was Stanford. I didn't get into my first two choices, and some of the smartest people I know who have far better credentials than I could ever attain (ISEF 1st place winner, Olympiad Qualifiers, RSI, etc.) didn't get into their dream schools. That's completely fine! Like I said before, college admissions is unpredictable, but not random. Before shotgunning or applying to a bunch of schools, remember that there's a high chance you may not get into the school you want to.\n\nI'm going to end this section off with a translated quote from one of my favorite movies of all time (3 Idiots): Don't pursue success; pursue excellence, and success will follow. I think this perfectly encapsulates my experience with college admissions. I've found that the common theme between several HYPSM admits I know is that they didn't care about college admissions until their senior year; instead, they focused on being excellent at what they enjoyed doing. If you do the same, there's a higher chance (although not guaranteed), that you will land one of your top choices.\n\n**If you want help in the admissions process, finding research, or tutoring, feel free to private message me, I'd love to help :)**", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1bx405h/indian_kid_from_the_south_bags_hypsm/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/1bx405h/indian_kid_from_the_south_bags_hypsm/", "upvotes": 75, "num_comments": 40, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "RSI"}

Fee waivers are fun 😅\n\n**Extracurriculars/Activities**\n\n- Summer Research Program summer before 12th (Don’t want to get specific but it’s in the tier right below RSI if that helps? Usually <10% acceptance rate, and I see people on A2C have mentioned\nit often in regards to STEM summer programs.)\n\n- Unpublished (in any significant capacity) bio research project. Got results but showed my interest (read: fixation) in bio research given limited resources than anything else.\n\n- President/Captain of Academic Decathlon for two years, member for four. Led team to state for the first time and won some scholarships.\n\n- Some advocacy for environmental justice organization (lots of phonebanking and interviewed the director)\n\n- There were other ECs, but they were smaller and supplemented the interest in STEM that I established through whatever research I could do. Not too many on-campus activities, if I’m being honest.\n\n- Mentioned side hobbies like writing and publishing fiction online (~70k hits at the time lol) and a culturally connected pretty unique art hobby that I talk about in my PIQ\n\n**Awards/Honors**\n\nKinda small on paper and contributed little to nothing but they meant a lot to my personal growth 😪\n\n- $1000 Academic Decathlon Scholarship (for being the top scorer in the county for my GPA category) \n\n- Perfect speech score in AcaDeca, probably one or two people out of ~500 get this a year in my county. Got a state level award for the same speech.\n\n- 1st Place school creative writing contest award (REALLY REACHING HERE)\n\n**Letter of Recommendation**\n\n- Was requested an LoR by Berkeley and put down my mentor who watched me grow personally even my personal circumstances affected my academics.

Was it a fluke? Who knows? All I know is that Berkeley took a chance on me when I fucked around and found out. I committed to Cal in the end and finally took a chance on myself. It’s turning out well: I’m doing exponentially better than I ever did in high school, personally and academically.\n\nAnalytically, I have far from an ideal application on paper. I still wonder if I “stole” a spot from someone who worked their ass off with better results. I’ll maintain, though, that my writing saved me. My PIQs and additional statement were crucial to establishing that a) I had legitimate circumstances that affected my high school career and b) I did the best that I could and have the potential to succeed given the opportunity. I also ended up having a neat narrative centered around a natural curiosity in biology and beyond. If you’re in a similar situation, holistically minded schools (like Berkeley, relative to the other UCs) might not be as out of reach as you think.\n\nI’ll end by saying the Berkeley acceptance is an exception, not the rule 💀 But I’m also proof that those exceptions exist.\n\nGood luck y’all!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/18tmv49/asian_girl_struggled_through_hs_bagged_one/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/18tmv49/asian_girl_struggled_through_hs_bagged_one/", "upvotes": 120, "num_comments": 32, "flair": "3.0+|Other|STEM", "query_matched": "RSI"}

I’ve seen a lot of conflicting views on what to put here, so I was pretty cautious about it. I think the right answer is just to put what you need, to help AOs get a clearer picture on who you are fully. This is how I formatted mine–\\*italics are just comments for this post.\n\n**College Courses @ CMU**\n\nConcepts of Mathematics (*First year basically discrete mathematics course. A lot of fun, but super rigorous*)*:* A, 96%\n\nMethods of Statistics and Data Science (S*econd year stats course; it wasn’t bad at all, and delved a bit into ML*)*:* A, 95%\n\n**Athletic Honors**\n\nAll-American 2nd Team, USA Fencing (11)\n\nAll-Academic 1st Team, Absolute Fencing (11)\n\n**AP/Merit Honors**\n\nAP Scholar with Distinction (12)\n\nNational Merit Semifinalist (12)\n\n**Additional Piano Honors**\n\n*I listed some other performances and awards here!*\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**LORs (8/10):**\n\nI think that as a whole, these letters really helped solidify my application. A lot of the stuff I did was leadership based, and it wasn’t really able to be quantified--the rec letters helped back up the amount of effort and time I had put into these activities, and I think they really helped my personality shine through my application.\n\nCS Teacher (9/10): I had him my freshman and sophomore years of high school–super duper engaged in his class, he really helped catapult me to start some independent projects, and kept in touch later w/ a few more independent CS projects. Probably my favorite teacher that I’ve had throughout HS.\n\nEnglish Teacher (6/10): I’m not sure--I had heard he gives good recs, but only had him for one semester in AP Lang. I asked a lot of questions in class and talked to him a lot independently about writing and writing styles in general, out of class. I had a really weird writing phase my junior year of HS? Like a ton of purple prose, and weird emotional stuff? I think I was basically emo in 11th grade.\n\nMusic Teacher (8/10): I had been volunteering to play with his school ensembles since I was a freshman. He knows about my practice schedule and how big of a part music plays in my life (since I stayed every day after school to practice), and he knows me as a person pretty well.\n\nCoach (9/10): He’s definitely seen the best side of me, and has seen my enthusiasm for fencing. Really looked up to him as a coach and friend–has been there through 4 years of HS, and has seen me grow from a super quiet freshman to who I am now.\n\n**Common App Essay (9/10):**\n\nIt was  a stream-of-consciousness essay–super romantic-era in style, talking about how this one moment fencing helped me stop seeing people as competition, but more as friends and others who shared my passion. Unlike a lot of the other styles I had seen online, I didn’t just do an anecdote as a hook, and then go into like retrospective thinking--I just stayed in the anecdote for the entire essay. It felt really risky, because I knew for sure I didn’t talk about my application as much as I should have--but it went really in depth to one part of my personality. Basically, the essay was 100% depth, 0% breadth.\n\nI was also very hesitant on this topic because I felt that the initial part of the essay (talking about how I saw others as competition) was really negative. However, I think it really showcased growth well, and touched on an important part of my personality--connecting and interacting with others.\n\n**Interviews**\n\nMIT (0/10): SO BAD. This was my first interview as well and it was a pretty jarring experience. I kept answering questions, and he kept saying like. “No … that wasn’t the answer I was looking for … try again?” After that, I started talking about my CS projects, and he just absolutely drilled me. I talked about the algorithms I implemented in some of my projects, so on and so forth, and he kept quizzing me. I literally went back and studied my old projects again after this interview so I would be ready for the other interviewers?? (thankfully no one else quizzed me on the technicalities of my old projects again).\n\nWe had take a brief walk after, and talked about the weather for a while, so it also maybe made up for it? 😀\n\nHarvard (4/10): Pretty mid. The student actually went to the same school I did, but we didn’t really connect on many fronts.\n\nYale (5/10): Pretty mid, but better than Harvard? It was just a typical interview, typical questions, and really straightforward.\n\nStanford (8/10): Good! My interviewer had actually seen some of my piano performances before! She was a super duper interesting person, and I really enjoyed talking to her.\n\nPrinceton (11/10): SO GOOD. My interviewer and I actually talked for 3-4 hours over Zoom, and just talked about really random experiences and times we had in our lives. We went like really in-depth about ourselves, and honestly, I think I connected with her more than I have with some of my friends. Super duper duper duper positive experience. Still in contact with my interviewer now!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**I applied to everything as a CS major (some under the arts college instead of the engineering college).**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**EA:**\n\nUT Austin (OOS): >!REJECTED. !<\n\nUIUC: >!REJECTED. A lot of my friends got in that day, so I was in genuine pain.!<\n\nUMich (OOS): >!Waitlisted. I heard they waitlisted a lot of OOS for EA, so I wasn’t too worried.!<\n\nUVA: >!ACCEPTED! My good friend goes to this school, so I was really happy. Look up to her a lot too, so this made me excited to possibly go!!<\n\nGeorgia Tech (OOS): >!ACCEPTED! This was like two hours after UIUC so I recovered from my depression.!<\n\nYale (REA): >!Deferred. I was happy that I didn’t get rejected though? I had a dream a few nights before that I got in, so I was 🙏 that it would manifest. It did not. I think the biggest pain actually came from the fact I knew I needed to grind apps for like 3 more weeks throughout winter break :(!<\n\n**UC SCHOOLS:** I’m guilty of just spamming UC. Really wanted Berkeley and UCLA, but thought might as well?\n\nUCSB: >!Accepted!<\n\nUCI: >!Accepted!<\n\nUCSD: >!Accepted!<\n\nUC Davis: >!Accepted!<\n\nUC Berkeley: >!Rejected!<\n\nUCLA:  >!Rejected!<\n\nThe irony.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**RD:** I was coming into RD … not deathly afraid? but still pretty afraid. I had gotten into GT already, so if all didn’t work out, I would still be able to go there (but I really really really didn’t like the GT campus and the Southern weather…). I knew that it shouldn’t account too much into how one views where they’re going, but I guess I didn’t love the vibe there? I loved their THREADS curriculum though, so I was looking forward to it academically (for prospective GT applicants, I would recommend looking into this program)! I was really looking forward to a few schools. For Brown, I thought I would have a bit better than slim chance, since I submitted a video portfolio that I was personally super proud of. For Princeton, I was really hoping my interview would help carry through. For Yale, I was just praying.\n\nHarvard: >!Rejected. Childhood dreams gone :(!<\n\nMIT: >!Rejected!<\n\nUMich: >!Waitlisted. NOOOOOOOO SAD. I actually really loved UMich as a school and as a campus (its soooo pretty). This put me in my feels too :(!<\n\nNorthwestern: >!Waitlisted!<\n\nVanderbilt: >!Waitlisted!<\n\nBrown: >!Waitlisted. This was the first I had opened on Ivy Day. It was pretty crushing, since I thought that my personality was the best fit for Brown out of the rest of the schools. I didn’t think I would have any more luck that night :/!<\n\nUPenn: >!Waitlisted. Also pain. I had a friend who I looked up to a lot who went here, and I really wanted to join him. Also, I love the campus? (ignoring the skyscrapers)!<\n\nPrinceton: >!Waitlisted.!<\n\nCornell: >!Waitlisted!<\n\nYale: >!ACCEPTED! Really surprised especially after my MID interview. !<\n\nDuke: >!ACCEPTED!!<\n\nCMU SCS: >!ACCEPTED! AAHH!!<\n\nStanford: >!I DID NOT BELIEVE THIS WHEN I OPENED IT. ACCEPTED → COMMITTED!!<\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Comments**\n\nThe college application process was brutal for me. There were a lot of restless nights, and a lot of anxiety and fear. I think my biggest mistake was making college apps my life--I really didn't talk to my friends much, and didn't really confide in anyone about my mental health. If I were to do it again, I'd definitely try to pace myself a bit more, and make it more sustainable.\n\nOverall, there’s a few things that I think helped my application stand out. I think the first was my common app essay. It was a super risky essay though--I really took in the advice to show not tell, which is why I made it a stream-of-consciousness essay. Up till I submitted my application, I kept questioning the validity of the essay, and if it told enough about me and who I was to the AOs. At the end of EA, I yoloed it though? After more reflection for the RD round, I realized that this essay was pretty good–it helped demonstrate more about my personality than if I were to directly comment on it (like how all the “JHU Essays that Worked” essays go). In retrospect, I would say to not be afraid to take risks. I would use my essays to show my personality, not the personality of the another essay I saw online. I think that everyone has different writing styles–there aren’t good and bad styles. There are just different styles.\n\nSecond, I organized my activity list in more of a category-grouping sort of way instead of how much time I spent on it, or how impressive I thought it sounded. So overall, it came out to be like\n\n(1-2) Piano\n\n(3-5) Fencing-related\n\n(6-10) More leadership\n\nOrganizing it like this helped me find out the main themes that I wanted in my application. For my activity list, I think including digital media production was sort of a unique thing? It definitely didn’t really fit the gradient of the other activities listed. However, it was an activity that meant a lot to me, and so I included it. I personally think that it doesn't matter how impressive an activity is or how much time you spent--if it means a lot, I would put it in! Like, there are a few CS/DS related internships that I had done over the years that I opted out of including, because they didn't really have much of a personal impact on me, and grow my character. They would have most likely shown I was more qualified for CS , but I felt as it just didn't fit who I was as much as the other activities did. Finally, a few more comments.\n\n* I really don’t think those big corporation college counselors are worth it. They not only try to manufacture “passion” in your application, but their practices are just pretty ethically questionable in general. They are kinda scams too, for the price they’re worth. I would talk to someone I trust,  close friends and teachers--they'll provide invaluable insight compared to some strangers that you hire!\n* I did a lot of self reflection! College apps was really about discovering who I am. I had to take a lot of time to figure out why I want to do what I want to do, and put my story on paper. It's very hard to put the human experience into words, which is why I think college apps is so hard sometimes.\n* I think AOs really do care about personality and initiative. Initiative is one of the biggest things I think that make applications stand out. If you see something in your community that needs fixing, take that initiative, no matter how big or how small. Genuine effort shows in your community as well as in an application.\n\nI spent a lot of time on this subreddit while I was applying, and after seeing so many applications, my biggest anxiety was not having a huge huge spike in STEM (no RSI, no ISEF). Uploading this application, I wanted to just show people applying that you don't need to always have a huge spike in some certain area--just be yourself, and you'll do good!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/162lxd8/2023_asian_male_in_cs_hypsm/", "permalink": "https://www.reddit.com/r/collegeresults/comments/162lxd8/2023_asian_male_in_cs_hypsm/", "upvotes": 294, "num_comments": 53, "flair": "3.8+|1500+/34+|STEM", "query_matched": "RSI"}

I gushed like a Twitch tier 3 subscriber simp about my time at Cornell engineering camp and what I learned from it and what research I’ve done on what shenanigans they are working on and how I see myself working on them.

YOUR CONTEXT MATTERS!!!  Both your life circumstances and where you come from. For me, I showed a lot of resilience🤓 ☝️ throughout my life, especially for academics. If I were less determined or did not have the goal of wanting to have a normal life and go to college and pull girls or whatever shit redditors do, I would not have clawed myself through high school and woulda just dropped out fr. Also, if I applied to top schools in my area instead of on the other side of the country I probably would have been steamrolled because I am competing against my entire school as opposed to almost no other applicants from my school 💀.\n\nAdditionally, I get the “sob story” essay is a meta strat right now, but I genuinely could not have applied without writing about my context. I think it makes up for my slightly weak stats, as some of my peers have 4.4 GPA and 1570 SAT like what are you smoking.  In junior year, I totally griefed a few of my classes and got 4 B’s, 3 which were in AP STEM classes😍😍. But I tried my best to convey my circumstances, as it was relevant to all of my high school career. I think I got a bit of a pardon (ok i probably did bc every college looked past it) because of me speedrunning a bunch of Real Life Shit emphasis on Shit🔥🔥🔥🔥. For me, essays definitely saved my goofy ahh but also, I am extremely fortunate for my results.\n\n2) OK YEAH BABEY about the Cornell Camp. I think it is worth mentioning because there is little about it online. The camp I went to was called CURIE, and it’s an engineering camp for all girls. Sorry dudes. Jk not sorry, there is a co-ed equivalent called CATALYST search it up 😁. If that hasn’t caught your attention yet, out of the right-under-50 admits that I know of (and I don't know everyone), at least 4 of them got into Cornell, and at least another 10 to t20’s like Jonhs Hopkinbs and Harvar. Maybe this is correlation instead of causation but for me it definitely solidified my want to ED to Corn. (INCOMING JUNIORS THIS IS GENUINELY SOMETHING YOU SHOULD APPLY TO!!) And yeah it gave me a lot to write about:\n\nI was shotgunning to summer camps because uhhhh the cool kids were doing it and got waitlisted from SSP and had a bad day but then CURIE let me in (hooray). I did not know what to feel about it first because, again, there is not as much online about it as summer camps like SSP, RSI, YYGS (wow I need to touch grass) but I am so glad I went it was fire. Cornell Engineering really put in their cornussy into this because every day we had no less than 2 real life professors!111!!1 talk about their major and give us cool demonstrations. Most notably was the dude who preached about concrete for an hour he made concrete sound fire 🔥🔥🔥🔥. There was a literal Cornell admissions panel where we met with a real life AO and asked questions. And then we got to fuck and ball and do scavenger hunts around the campus (glorified campus tour fr), rock climbing, steal the campus blueberries, etc. Food was awesome. 10/10 experience and made a ton of friends I still keep in touch with. Highly recommend.\n\n3) Since my stats aren’t \\*outstanding\\* for pure Engineering/CS, I was gonna art my way into colleg with a portfolio<3 and art EC’s. I did not think I had a shot at something that is pretty much hardcore STEM and was ready to go all hOLisTIc (the holistic in question: silly drawings). I’ve always been an artist, hence the many art EC’s. I’m not sure if that is enough to be a “peak” but definitely very time consuming (maybe if I drew less I woulda had a higher GPA LMAO). But yeah I was boutta art my way to the CMU BCSA program fr if ED didn’t work out. But it is worth mentioning I did submit an art portfolio to Corn. Maybe it helped.

I'm kinda introverted and sometimes I say weird things in a panic!  I really clicked with my Yale interviewer though (except for the part where I told him I wanted to go to Berkeley lol but he was a really cool dude) and I was strangely similar to my MIT interviewer (we went to the same school, both wanted to get away from home, did research in HS at the same uni, and her kid was in one of the science enrichment programs I run).  Did not click with my Harvard and Princeton interviewers...it was giving \"I'm better than everybody else since I was selected to attend this prestigious institution\" vibes (no shade tho!  I'm sure they're incredible people in their daily lives).  No interview at Stanford.\n\n**Essays**\n\n5/10 -- average, definitely not \"OMG SO MEMORABLE\"...I read them and I sounded like the most average A2Cer you've ever met in most of them lol\n\nEC essays: talked about science enrichment programs I've started + how it helped me grow as a person/leader\n\n\"Intellectual\" Supplementals: Love for history + interest in preserving stories, connected to my more humanities based ECs\n\nOther supps:  I like writing.  Very quirky roommate essay.  #womaninstem.  I like puns (still cringing from reading these).  I am nerd.  Are you?\n\nCA: journey w/ science, from immediate family being diagnosed w/ life-threatening illness to working in lab --> how it made me want to become a physician-scientist (I got the lowest grade I've ever gotten on an English essay for this essay when we had to turn it in in my English class and my former English teacher said it was trash so I tried to reform it but it did not work and it was close to the early deadline/I had procrastinated on the RD deadline so uh yeah)\n\n**Results (in order of when I received them so you can feel the rollercoaster of emotions I went through!)**\n\nEARLY\n\nHarvard: >!Deferred!<\n\nUSC: >!Accepted!

(WHAT? PINCH ME??)!<\n\nYes, I applied to almost 30 schools.  After getting deferred from Harvard I got super panicked I wasn't qualified for anywhere since I overestimated the legacy boost and I didn't want to feel like I could've gone somewhere if I had just applied.  I guess it's advice time! \n\n(DISCLAIMER:  I AM NOT A PROFESSIONAL BY ANY MEANS AND THESE ARE ENTIRELY ALL MY OWN OPINIONS)\n\n1. **START EARLY** (like, June) -- essays genuinely matter.  Yes, everybody says this, but also, EVERYBODY SAYS THIS SO MAYBE IT MEANS SOMETHING.\n2. **Controversial, but don't apply to your dream school(s) early.**  You get a lot better with writing as you continue to go through the process, and I'm convinced my Harvard essays are what got me flat out rejected...they likely would've been a lot better if I had applied RD\n3. **Apply to schools with early scholarship deadlines** \\-- I applied to USC, Vandy, and Emory early for their scholarship deadlines and I got some big money at 2/3 of them.  It also significantly lightened my RD stress because I knew I had already applied to 12 schools early (including UCs and Harvard), so all the other applications I was doing were just icing on the cake.\n4. **Lower your expectations and have multiple dream schools.**  As a middle schooler I had HYPSM dreams and what not, but by high school I realized it wasn't a good mindset to have a T5 as a dream school, so I instead had several relatively achievable schools as \"dream\" schools -- Rice, Northwestern, Penn, Berkeley, UCLA.  Obviously they're still incredibly hard to get into (got waitlisted by half of them lmao), but it was still an incredible feeling to get into Berkeley and UCLA after watching tons of vlogs and knowing friends/family who went to the schools and made me excited about them.\n5. **Also controversial, but shotgun if you have the resources/fee waivers**.  After 10 or so schools, a lot of the essays are the same and reusable.  The admissions process is so random (how did I get waitlisted by Emory and not get into any other T10s except T5s?) that applying to just a few schools isn't going to cut it unless you're a cracked applicant or just very lucky. \n6. **Don't be afraid to be yourself** \\-- I wrote about dancing in my room and writing bad songs in my Stanford supplement and I told USC I would like to have lofi girl as a roommate and I'm a \"Cali girl\" at heart.  It's kinda cheesy but I think the cringe makes you stand out!!\n7. **\"Spikes\" are overrated:  be well rounded!**  I guess I kinda have a science spike, but it wasn't just a science spike -- I did community service, some writing, some advocacy.  I was interested in a lot of stuff throughout high school and dipped my toes in a bunch of places.  It's a lot more fun to do a variety of things too, and you get to interact with a lot of different but interesting people.  I also think it shows you're more human?  Like you're not just some robot who studies and does research and enters olympiads all the time (for STEM kids -- if you're a humanities kid you're prob fine just writing/doing history research/doing cool advocacy stuff).\n8. **Learn how to say no.**  Being well-rounded works up to a point.  If you're too spread out, you can't really develop strengths anywhere and you'll end up being a member (or worse, a leader who doesn't do anything...) in all of the organizations/initiatives you're a part of.  Choose maybe 2-3 areas you really want to focus on and figure out how you can excel there, then stop accepting positions/opportunities outside of those areas.\n9. **If you end up with leadership, actually do something.**  There are tons of kids at my school who are president of a club but don't actually do anything with the club.  That works to an extent...but they forget that you actually have a description and essays you need to write for college apps.  Saying you led meetings and created presentations on xxxx topic is fine, but AOs can see you didn't really do anything except make a Google slides presentation during third period to present during lunch.  Look for competitions to study for, volunteer programs to join or create, and issues in your community that you want to address.                                                     \n10. **In a similar vein, think of ways you can expand your prestige, social, and monetary footprint with your activities.**  Prestige = competitons/recognition/awards.  Social = people impacted/involved in initiatives.  Monetary = funds raised/managed.  I hate to say this, but that's what the AOs are looking for in your activities descriptions.\n11. **You don't need to be voted in to be a leader -- start your own thing.**  I am by no means a popular kid, and I lost most of the elections I ran for.  When you start something on your own, you have a lot more freedom with what exactly it does, how it operates, and the influence/power of the initiative.\n12. **For summer programs/activities:  things you start (passion project™️) > paid > free > you have to pay.**  RSI/SSP/Ross/SUMAC/Olympiad Camps/governor schools are exceptions (lol that's actually a lot).\n13. **Participate in class.**  Go to office hours.  Ask questions.  If you're worried about LORs, you can fake it until you make it.\n14. **Always be on the lookout for opportunities/awards.**  There's a lot of low-hanging fruit, you just need to find it.  Ask your teachers, ask your counselor, look on online databases, look through Instagram hashtags, look at the tagged posts of \\~accomplished\\~ people, go down the \"free summer programs for high schoolers\" or \"awards for high school publications\" or \"writing contests for high school students\" or \"grants for youth community service projects\" rabbit hole on Google. \n15. **Don't underestimate yourself!**  There were multiple points in my high school journey where I felt like I wasn't good enough (ie getting rejected from tons of summer programs, not getting scholarships, people not joining clubs/initiatives I started) or I was trying hard for no reason, but I genuinely think anybody can get into a good college if they have the will and initiative.  If you apply to enough things, you'll eventually get something decently selective/prestigious, and then you can milk the life out of it everytime you apply for anything else.  Also, even if you don't get into a \"good\" college, you really do learn a lot along the way.  I grew my self confidence, my leadership, my friendships, and my time management skills throughout high school by doing what I did, and those are skills/people that I will cherish for the rest of my life.\n16. **Be nice to people.**  If you take anything away from this, please let it be this point.  I met some pretty...unsavory people (really just one person, but if one person exists I am sure there are multiple others in other schools) in high school who were obsessed with winning competitions and gaining leadership positions.  I'd get threatening texts and conversations (like this person literally pulled me out of a class just to tell me I was a terrible leader just because she didn't get her way??) and I had to go to multiple counselors just to deal with the person being so power hungry, and that was not fun.  So be nice.  College admissions may seem like the world to you right now, but it's really not that big of a deal, and I think how you treat others says a lot more about you than what colleges you get into.\n\nAnyways, currently trying to decide between Yale and Stanford for pre-med!

She liked my writing style, but again this was not a crucial component in my application.\n\nCounselor - 6/10. Probably average.\n\n**Essays**\n\n8/10. It’s difficult to rate one’s own writing because I’m inclined to give a 10/10, and my English teacher seemed to like it a lot as did my parents and several college students. Some were skeptical, and I would say that on average it was around an 8 out of 10. I talked about how a personal disorder affected my STEM ideologies and led to growth.\n\n**Decisions (indicate ED/EA/REA/SCEA/RD)**\n\n*Acceptances:*\n\n* Dartmouth (ED)\n\n**Advice to RD and Future Candidates:** Make sure you are taking the most rigorous possible course load that you possibly can! Make sure you are doing more than every other classmate. Dual Enrollment, AP, and IB are the way to go, and I tried to load up on these and I think it set me apart from other classmates. Course rigor is an aspect I cannot underline enough, and various scores (SAT, AP) deserve a lot of attention to. Take as many AP’s as you possibly can no matter what - I even got my counselor to waive a general ed requirement so I could fit in APUSH. The personal statement matters too! It helps if it’s about one of your extracurriculars that will be well-known - I tied it into Science Olympiad, my major STEM activity. My counselor + and a former admissions officer that I showed my essay to both said that it was a refreshing read compared to boring Science Olympiad essays they had read in the past because it took a new approach. I can explain this more in DM’s - writing about a common activity can be a good thing if you put a new spin on it because it’ll make you stand out! Wacky essays could work, but I feel like standing out in this manner I mentioned is an easier and safer route that is still effective.\n\nIn the end, I would say course rigor is the most important part, followed by SAT/ACT/AP/etc. and then personal essay, and the ec's, supplementals, recommendations all felt like noise. This is what worked for me and I hope it can help others!

I am a low income blakc woman, so if you’re going to see that and assume that was the only reason they accepted me—then be thankful I let you know at the beginning. \n\nI did extracurriculars that all tied in together. I was the head of the Black and Latino Student Group at my elite private boarding school that I went to on a full ride scholarship. My college essay was about my struggle with class identity at this school and how I shifted the shame I felt from being poor freshman year to pride and educated my schools community on issues facing poor Black and Hispanic communities. Everyone at my school knew me for being “an activist”. (But now that I’m in college I hate that I kind of sold my oppression for the white audience but whatever). \n\nI was a tour guide at my school and became the head of tour guides my senior year. My grades were good but not stellar. I had like One “A” each year from my french class. I took french every year and said I wanted to continue in college. I did spoken word, dance, and tried sports the first two years but didn’t stick with it. I’d say my average was a 3.5 gpa. \n\nWhat I think was unique, was that I wrote TWO personal statements. Wanna know how? In the section where they ask for additional information, and where the word count is also 650 words, I used that to write about my extenuating financial circumstances and my family’s dynamic that make it so important that I receive a good college education that is wel financed. My dad was deported and I talked about how that made me want to go into immigration law and civil rights activism and blah blah. Guilt tripping white admissions officers? Maybe..but read to the end to know why NYU admissions is different (I’m an NYU Ambassador now so I know the tea). \n\nOOH A MAJOR PLUS: I was a participant in the Telluride Association summer Program (TASP) which is this extremely selective and prestigious summer program that’s 6 weeks long and is headed by professors at elite college universities. It is very cult like and I definitely had a good time but that university program  Is very highly regarded because of the exclusivity. It’s an old program and definitely a great opportunity if you can get in. Mike was at Cornell but like we lived in a frat house and had weird house meetings where we deliberated chores in a United Nations kind of way. Weird as fvck. I had no idea about it’s eliteness when I applied.. I honeslty just wanted to not be home for another summer   But that must have been a Boost in my application form because from that program, you are given recommendations for colleges from ur TASP PROFESSORS. Mine taught at  Stanford and the other at That Jewish college that starts with a B. They also tried to help me with my college essays but hoenstly it was just grammatical shit and nothing with depth. I wrote my essay on my own cause I’m actually an amazing writer.  \n\nI can’t remember my other extracurriculars besides initiating my schools first national conference. I didn’t create the conference, I only got us to go to a preexisting one on diversity.\n\nMy why NYU essay was also pretty good. It had the right amount of cheesy “did u research NYU?”-ness. And the rigjt amount of genuineness. I talked about how I wanted to attend Gallatin for my very specific major that related exactly to the research done by a professor at Gallatin who is now my advisor and whom I love dearly.  I was specific in my reasoning to majoring in something such as that, and honestly there was no lying there. I didn’t actually want to go to NYU...cause my sister was there and I wanted a “real college”... but they offered me the best money and was better than the other schools I got into. \n\nLastly. I am an HEOP STUDENT  SO MY ADMISISON TO NYU WAS FUNDED THROYGH THE NYU op program Which aids lower income students at NYU to get further academic and fiancial support over their college years. This program Automatically reads all applicants from New York and then assesses ur financial need. Nothing about ur NYU experience is different besides a mandatory summer program u do and the free money u get for being a happy poor kid in NY. U get an additional useless advisor and a cool community. \n\nSo yes. Affirmative action benefitted me. My application screamed poverty but also passion. And it should. I got opportunities almost no Black kids from the Bronx are exposed to. I worked my ass off teaching white people about racism for 4 years. I suffered with racist teachers and a racist environment where i still studied well enough  and now I’m at a great diverse school with a supportive community that I get from OP and my clubs. I always give the advice that NYU literally does not care if ur a 1500 sat student if your boring on paper. It’s a school for cool kids.  And rich kids. But be cool. Half of the admissions team are gay millennials with Starbucks drinks and piercings. Be fun.

Could not have asked for a better letter, this definitely helped a lot with my apps. \n\nEnglish teacher - Probably good, she’s been impressed with my writing and I’m active in class but not much beyond that. \n\nChem teacher - Same deal.

Said I was her favorite interview in the past 4 years and she was really rooting for me to get in. \n\nDuke (6/10) - I didn’t really try ngl \n\nMIT (7/10) - It was over the phone since our Skype crashed lol. I had a concrete idea of what I want to do at MIT and what programs I would take advantage of and they took note. I also did an OCW class with a professor they had so we talked about that. \n\n**Essays**\n\n(*Briefly reflect on the quality of your writing, time spent, and topic of main personal statement.)*\n\nI LABORED over my essays. Common app was about feeling disconnected as a Native person away from my reservation but how my naming ceremony helped me rekindle my identity. I weaved that with how accepting my identity allowed me to confront our people’s issues instead of avoiding them, leading me to public health and using research as a tool for empowerment. Imo it was really well executed. \n\nSupplementals were more about how I want to pursue public health and connecting that to my identity and family history. I also talked a lot about SSP in my MIT essays.

For my app, having good stats and a good roster of activities was important, but I think what tipped me over the edge was my essays and narrative. Nothing I did was in isolation: through essays or interviews I connected all my activities to my story and my development as a person. Having something on paper is one thing but you have to be able to speak about it - why you’re doing it and the impact it's had. A few of my interviewers and AOs said they were really impressed with my commitment to health equity and Native causes and that was the overall narrative of my app. I knew what I wanted to do and that permeated through every part of my application. \n\nI’m still deciding between schools so advice is welcome.

Participated in one of the following summer programs: Clark, SSP, Simons, PROMYS, Ross\n2. Olympiad prep/self-studying STEM stuff: I spent a lot of time studying things just because I enjoyed them. I was the first person from my school district to get a national-level award in any olympiad. Definitely the most rewarding thing I did in high school and helped me build a strong knowledge base, which is probably the most distinctive part of my application.\n3. Quiz Bowl: Captain/leading scorer of my school’s quizbowl team. We were nationally competitive (top 50-100 ish in the country) and had some solid finishes at national championships. We also won states my freshman year.\n4. Did math circle/studied math: Learned stuff like abstract algebra, topology, real/complex analysis, etc. lots of proof-based stuff that I didn’t already take at a college or wanted to learn in greater detail. I did a lot of this through a well-regarded math circle\n5. Gym/Powerlifting/Fitness: My gym progress probably took more time than everything else I did in high school. I have the second highest bench press in my school's history (310 pounds). I'll get the highest by the end of the year trust. I went from 6’0/155 to 6’3/205 in 2 years.\n6.

My counselor said that it was the best she’d seen. Teacher apparently said I was his best student in 20+ years. I went to a few of his tutorials in freshman year to self study calc BC and took AP Phys C with him sophomore year.\n\nAP Lang Teacher: 7-8/10. She’s smart, a good writer, and has known me since age 5 (she’s also my friend’s mom lmao). I’m an above average (but not stellar) English student, so she didn’t have as much to go off of. Definitely a solid LOR, but nothing like what my physics teacher wrote.\n\nCounselor Rec 8-9/10: She def likes me a lot and knows me very well. As far as counselor LOR’s go, this one was probably pretty good. Well above average fs (especially when you consider counselors have to write for 100+ students and they barely know most of them).\n\n**Essays:**\n\nI spent a lot of time writing my essays and had a lot of people (teachers, my school counselor, friends at elite unis, parents) look over my essays. They were pretty well-received.\n\nCommonApp: 8/10. I don’t have any crazy life stories, but I talked a lot about one of the ECs I listed above. It’s not in that upper echelon of essays that can get someone with <1400 SAT and mid ECs into HYPSM, but it was noticeably above average.\n\nSupps: 8/10: Some were probably close to a 9 and others were in the 6/7 range. Overall, they were strong essays.\n\n**Interviews so far:**\n\nI'm not convinced that these are that important (only edge cases really matter). They're pretty much just to make sure you're not an asshole.\n\nHarvard: 8/10. Connected pretty well with my interviewer and we had a lot to talk about because his kids went to my high school. Was irl and lasted about 1.5 hrs.\n\nMIT: 7/10. Was pretty short but she told me it had to be under 40 minutes before it even started. I answered all the questions without stumbling and communicated everything I wanted to about myself. She said she was rooting for me.\n\nYale Senior Interview: 5.5/10. Stumbled a bit at the beginning because I didn't spend enough time workshopping answers to common questions. I think I came across pretty well though.\n\n**Decisions:**\n\nU of Oklahoma (Rolling): Accepted with lots of money for NMF and a few other random scholarships\n\nHarvard (REA): Deferred. Terrible decision in retrospect bc Harvard REA does nothing for unhooked/non-athlete/non-legacy applicants, especially if they are academics-oriented.\n\nGeorgia Tech (EA2, OOS): Accepted + 20k/year (Dean’s Scholarship)\n\n**Withdrawn:**\n\nUGA\n\nMay decide to withdraw a few more schools (UVA and UNC maybe) but I'll prolly just wait for everything to come back\n\n**Waiting on:**\n\nUF (OOS).

Every step of the way, from securing letters of recommendation to building a competitive application, I had to figure it out on my own.\n\nLooking back, I’m incredibly grateful for the growth that came with the struggle. And that’s exactly why I’m passionate about giving back and supporting those who are coming up behind me.\n\nFor a small, negotiable fee per session, I offer personalized premed mentorship that includes:\n\n• Application and personal statement review\n\n• Mock interviews and interview prep\n\n• Reviewing your school list and activities section\n\n• Strategic planning, resources, and networking advice\n\n**My College background:**\n\n• Graduated in the top 5% of my class in 3.5 years.\n\n• 4.0 science GPA • MCAT: 514\n\n• Accepted to my #1 choice medical school\n\n• Debt-free college graduation\n\n**Medical School:**\n\n• Passed Step 1\n\n• Scored in the top 20th percentile on Step 2\n\n• Inducted into AOA (Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society – highly selective)\n\n• Gold Humanism Honor Society member\n\n• Top 5% of my medical school class\n\nIf you’re interested or have any questions, feel free to DM me!
