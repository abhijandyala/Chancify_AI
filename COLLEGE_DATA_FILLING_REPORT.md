## Data Quality Issues

### 1. Acceptance Rate Estimates
- **Elite schools**: Estimated at 8% (should be 3-10%)
- **Highly Selective**: Estimated at 20% (should be 10-25%)
- **Moderately Selective**: Estimated at 50% (should be 25-60%)
- **Less Selective**: Estimated at 80% (should be 60%+)

### 2. Selectivity Tier Issues
- Many colleges may be misclassified
- Some "Elite" schools might not actually be elite
- Some "Less Selective" schools might be more selective

### 3. Location Data Issues
- Some colleges show "Unknown" for city/state
- Location data may be incomplete or incorrect

## Recommendations

1. **Get real acceptance rate data** from IPEDS or College Board
2. **Verify selectivity classifications** against actual acceptance rates
3. **Complete location data** for all colleges
4. **Validate tuition costs** against current year data
5. **Verify major strength scores** against actual program rankings
