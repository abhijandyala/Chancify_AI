## Usage Notes

1. **Weights are relative**: A 25% weight means it's 25% as important as the sum of all factors, not an absolute probability contribution.

2. **College-specific adjustments**: Individual colleges may weight factors differently. The ML model will learn these patterns.

3. **Missing data handling**: If a factor doesn't apply (e.g., no athletics, test-optional), the weight redistributes proportionally to other factors.

4. **Holistic review**: Real admissions are holistic. These weights model the statistical importance, not rigid rules.

5. **Context matters**: Every factor is evaluated within the student's personal and school context.
