# Chancify AI

AI-powered college admissions probability calculator with personalized game plans.

## Overview

Chancify AI helps students understand their chances of admission to colleges based on comprehensive factors including:
- Academic performance (GPA, test scores, course rigor)
- Extracurricular activities and leadership
- Essays, recommendations, and interviews
- Special considerations (athletics, legacy, demographics)
- Application strategy and timing
